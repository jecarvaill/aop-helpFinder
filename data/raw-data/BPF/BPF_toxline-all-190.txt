ABSTRACT:
      Since bisphenol F (4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane) has been reported to
      exhibit estrogen agonistic properties in the uterotrophic assay, we
      performed a 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study (enhanced OECD test
      guideline No. 407) on bisphenol F based on the OECD draft protocols to
      determine whether it has endocrine-mediated properties. Bisphenol F was
      orally administered at doses 0, 20, 100 and 500 mg/kg per day for at least
      28 days, but no clear endocrine-mediated changes were detected, and it was
      concluded to have no endocrine-mediated effects in young adult rats. On
      the other hand, the main effect of bisphenol F was concluded to be liver
      toxicity based on clinical biochemical parameters and liver weight, but
      without histopathological changes. The no-observed-effect level for
      bisphenol F is concluded to be under 20 mg/kg per day since decreased body
      weight accompanied by decreased serum total cholesterol, glucose, and
      albumin values were observed in the female rats given 20 mg/kg per day or
      higher doses of bisphenol F.

ABSTRACT:
      16 patients with contact allergy to phenol-formaldehyde resins (P-F-R)
      were patch tested with 3 dihydroxydiphenyl methanes (bisphenol F). The
      chemical investigation by high pressure liquid chromatography indicated
      that the dihydroxydiphenyl methanes (HPM) were pure and separable. 9
      patients reacted to at least one HPM and all these gave positive test
      responses to 2,4(1)-HPM. 3 patients reacted simultaneously to 2,4(1)-HPM
      and 4,4(1)-HPM and one of these 3 patients reacted simultaneously to all 3
      HPM. No positive test responses were noted in 100 controls. 8 of the 9
      patients were also patch tested with 8 compounds with similar chemical
      structures to the HPM. Possible cross-reactions were observed in 2
      patients for 4-hydroxydiphenyl methane, 4,4(1)-dihydroxydiphenyl-2-propane
      (bisphenol A) and diethylstilbestrol. The 3 reported sensitizers may,
      theoretically, be generated during the manufacture of P-F-R. 2,4(1)-HPM
      and 4,4(1)-HPM have been demonstrated and there have been indications of
      2,2(1)-HPM in the P-F-R used in the routine test series at the department.

ABSTRACT:
      The sensitizing capacity of 2,2(1)-dihydroxydiphenyl methane (2,2(1)-HPM),
      4,4(1)-dihydroxydiphenyl methane (4,4(1)-HPM) and 2,4(1)-dihydroxydiphenyl
      methane (2,4(1)-HPM) was investigated with the guinea pig maximization
      test. These compounds are known contact sensitizers in phenol-formaldehyde
      resins. The study was performed to assess and compare their sensitizing
      capacities. A weak sensitizing capacity of 2,2(1)-HPM was demonstrated
      when the results for 2 separate series were added, while no sensitizing
      capacity was demonstrated for 4,4(1)-HPM or 2,4(1)-HPM. The compounds
      tested were chromatographically pure.

ABSTRACT:
      A new method for simultaneous determination of five bisphenols in canned
      energy drinks by UPLC with fluorescence detection, after clean up on
      molecularly imprinted polymers, is herein described. The method was
      validated at two concentration levels, calculating trueness, repeatability
      and within-laboratory reproducibility, specificity, linearity of detector
      response, the limits of quantifications and the limits of detection for
      each bisphenol. The method is specific, reliable and very sensitive,
      allowing for determination of bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE),
      bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol A
      diglycidyl ether (BADGE) down to 0.50ng/mL; it was employed to determine
      contamination levels from these bisphenols in forty energy drinks of
      different brands, collected from the market in Naples. BPA was detected in
      17 out of 40 samples (42.5%); in some energy drinks also BPF, BADGE and
      BFDGE were determined.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether
      (BADGE) are common components of epoxy coatings used in food packaging and
      in drinking water distribution systems. Thus, leachates from the epoxy may
      be exposed to the disinfectants free chlorine (Cl2/HOCl/OCl(-)) and
      monochloramine (MCA, NH2Cl). Bisphenols are known endocrine disrupting
      chemicals (EDC) with estrogenic activity. Chlorination by-products have
      the potential to have reduced or enhanced estrogenic qualities, and are,
      therefore, of interest. In this work, chlorination reactions for
      bisphenols and BADGE were explored (via LC/MS/MS) and kinetic modeling
      (using a pseudo-first order approach) was conducted to predict the fate of
      these compounds in drinking water. The half-lives of BPA and BPF with
      1      mg/L of free chlorine ranged from 3 to 35      min over the pH
      range from 6 to 11 and the temperature range of 10-25      &deg;C.
      Half-lives for reactions of BPA and BPF with a nominal MCA concentration
      of 3.5      mg/L as Cl2 were from 1 to 10 days and were greater at higher
      pH and lower temperature. Formation of chlorinated bisphenol A by-products
      was observed during the kinetic studies. BADGE was found unreactive with
      either oxidant.

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND: Simultaneous contact allergies to epoxy resins based on
      diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA-R) or epoxy resins of the bisphenol
      F-type and the reactive diluent phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) have been
      reported. The reason might be cross-reactivity, exposure to an epoxy resin
      system with PGE as a component, or contamination by PGE in the epoxy
      resin.

      AIMS: To study contamination by PGE, 20 commercial epoxy resins were
      analysed for the presence of PGE. To study contact allergy to PGE and its
      relation to epoxy resins by inserting PGE in the standard series.

      RESULTS: Among 2227 patients, 7 reacted to PGE. Of 23 (30%) patients, 7
      with contact allergy to DGEBA-R and 7/19 (37%) with contact allergy to an
      epoxy resin of the bisphenol F-type reacted to PGE. All 7 patients with
      contact allergy to PGE reacted both to the DGEBA-R and to the epoxy resin
      of the bisphenol F-type. PGE was found in 90% of the investigated resins.
      The amounts of PGE ranged between 0.004% w/w and 0.18% w/w.

      CONCLUSION: Most probably, the presence of PGE as a contaminant in epoxy
      resins is of minor importance for the sensitization, but possibly the
      contamination of PGE might elicit contact dermatitis in individuals with a
      high reactivity to PGE.

ABSTRACT:
      Conditions were established for the separation and analysis of bisphenol
      A, bisphenol F, and their diglycidyl ethers by micellar electrokinetic
      capillary chromatography (MECC). Good resolution was obtained for all
      compounds, although in order to achieve the separation of ortho-ortho,
      ortho-para, and para-para isomers of bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE),
      BFDGE x 2H(2)O and BFDGE x 2HCl, it was necessary to use a 25 microm id
      fused silica capillary. To increase sensitivity, a field-amplified sample
      injection (FASI)-MECC method was developed using 10 mM SDS solution as
      injection matrix and a 75 microm id fused silica capillary. Instrumental
      quality parameters such as LODs (  < 55 microg/L with standards),
      linearity (r(2)  > 0.999), and run-to-run and day-to-day precisions (RSD
      values lower than 12.5%) were determined. Finally, the suitability of the
      FASI-MECC method for the analysis of bisphenol A, bisphenol F, and their
      diglycidyl ethers in canned soft drinks was evaluated. Quantitation was
      performed by matrix-matched calibration using a plastic-bottled isotonic
      drink as matrix. The results showed that FASI-MECC is an economic method
      for the screening and quantitation of these kinds of compounds in soft
      drink beverages, with no loss of reproducibility, and effective at
      concentrations lower than the specific migration level values established
      by the European Union.

ABSTRACT:
      In this work a fast liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method using a C18 Fused Core&trade; column, was
      developed for the simultaneous analysis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether
      (BADGE), bisphenol A (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) glycidyl ether
      (BADGE&middot;H(2)O), bisphenol A bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether
      (BADGE&middot;2H(2)O), bisphenol A (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) glycidyl
      ether (BADGE&middot;HCl), bisphenol A bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) ether
      (BADGE&middot;2HCl) and bisphenol A
      (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)(2,3-dihydroxypropyl ether)
      (BADGE&middot;HCl&middot;H(2)O) and bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE),
      bisphenol F bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether (BFDGE&middot;2H(2)O),
      bisphenol F bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) ether (BFDGE&middot;2HCl). The
      LC method was coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, using an
      ESI source in positive mode and using the [M+NH(4)](+) adduct as precursor
      ion for tandem mass spectrometry experiments. The method developed was
      applied to the determination of these compounds in canned soft drinks and
      canned food. OASIS HLB solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges were used
      for the analysis of soft drinks, while solid canned food was extracted
      with ethyl acetate. Method limits of quantitation ranged from 0.13
      &mu;gL(-1) to 1.6 &mu;gL(-1) in soft drinks and 1.0 &mu;gkg(-1) to 4.0
      &mu;gkg(-1) in food samples. BADGE&middot;2H(2)O was detected in all the
      analyzed samples, while other BADGEs such as BADGE&middot;H(2)O,
      BADGE&middot;HCl&middot;H(2)O, BADGE&middot;HCl and BADGE&middot;2HCl were
      also detected in canned foods.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol F (BPF) was found in mustard up to a concentration of around
      8      mg      kg(-1). Contamination of the raw products or caused by the
      packaging could be ruled out. Also, the fact that only the 4,4'-isomer of
      BPF was detected spoke against contamination from epoxy resin or other
      sources where technical BPF is used. Only mild mustard made of the seeds
      of Sinapis alba contained BPF. In all probability BPF is a reaction
      product from the breakdown of the glucosinolate glucosinalbin with
      4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol as an important intermediate. Hot mustard made
      only from brown mustard seeds (Brassica juncea) or black mustard seeds
      (Brassica nigra) contained no BPF. BPF is structurally very similar to
      bisphenol A and has a similar weak estrogenic activity. The consumption of
      a portion of 20      g of mustard can lead to an intake of
      100-200      &micro;g of BPF. According to a preliminary risk assessment,
      the risk of BPF in mustard for the health of consumers is considered to be
      low, but available toxicological data are insufficient for a conclusive
      evaluation. It is a new and surprising finding that BPF is a natural food
      ingredient and that this is the main uptake route. This insight sheds new
      light on the risk linked to the family of bisphenols.

ABSTRACT:
      Human can be exposed to bis(hydroxyphenyl)methane (bisphenol F or BPF) and
      its derivatives as environment and food's contaminants. This study was
      investigated to identify and to compare toxic potency of BPF, BFDGE, and
      two of BPF metabolites using in vitro methods. BPF did not induce any
      genic mutation in bacteria when the Ames test was performed according to
      the OECD guideline. In contrast, using Human cell lines and Comet assay,
      we demonstrated that BPF and Bisphenol F Diglycidyl Ether (BFDGE) were
      effective on HepG2 cell DNA fragmentation at non-cytotoxic concentrations.
      DHB was also positive but at higher concentrations, near its limit of
      solubility. Neither BPF, nor DHB induced a positive response in the
      micronucleus assay. The increase of micronuclei observed when cells were
      exposed to BFDGE was mostly due to a cytotoxic effect. Concerning
      endocrine activities, BPF increased the luciferase activity in HepG2 cells
      transiently transfected with a concentration dependant pattern, DHB also
      induced a positive response but at highest concentrations. Estrogenic
      responses in the HepG2 cells differed with the estrogen receptor (ER)
      involved. Using MDA-kb2 cell line stably transfected with pMMTV-neo-Luc,
      only BPF was anti-androgenic at the highest concentration (10(-5)M). Then,
      we demonstrated using human cell lines, especially HepG2, BPF was the most
      toxic compound in term of genotoxicity and endocrine activities compared
      to DHB and BPF-OH, the free metabolites identified in rat urine when BPF
      was administrated to rats.

ABSTRACT:
      Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) is the monomer and most important
      contact allergen in epoxy resin(s) based on bisphenol A (DGEBA-R). Both
      thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-pressure liquid chromatography
      (HPLC) methods are available for the analysis of products containing
      DGEBA-R. With respect to detection and quantification, epoxy resins of the
      bisphenol F-type, i.e. epoxy resins containing the isomers of diglycidyl
      ethers of bisphenol F (DGEBF), are not as well investigated as DGEBA-R.
      The isomers of DGEBF are p,p'-DGEBF, o,p'-DGEBF and o,o'-DGEBF. Both
      p,p'-DGEBF and o,p'-DGEBF have been shown to be contact allergens in
      humans, and all 3 isomers are sensitizers in the guinea pig maximization
      test. We aimed (i). to develop HPLC methods for separation and
      purification of the individual DGEBF isomers, (ii). to detect and quantify
      the DGEBF isomers in epoxy resins of the bisphenol F-type and (iii). to
      evaluate and develop the TLC as a method for the detection of the DGEBF
      monomers. We found the total content of the DGEBF isomers in the
      investigated epoxy resins of the bisphenol F-type to vary from 17.0 to
      81.7% w/w. Some of them also contained 0.1-2.4% w/w DGEBA. The HPLC method
      showed a sensitivity that was 2000-20 000x higher than that obtained with
      the TLC method for the DGEBF monomers. We concluded that the range of the
      DGEBF isomer content in epoxy resins of the bisphenol F-type is
      approximately the same as the monomer content in liquid compared to solid
      DGEBA-R. The relevance of contact allergy to DGEBA-R can remain
      unrecognized if the suspected product is an epoxy resin of the bisphenol
      F-type, which is analysed with the TLC method.

ABSTRACT:
      A novel, simple and selective electrochemical method was developed for
      simultaneous determination of bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol AF (BPAF) in
      aqueous media (phosphate buffer solution, pH 6.0) on carboxyl
      functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified glassy carbon
      electrode (MWCNT-COOH/GCE) using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). In
      DPV, MWCNT-COOH/GCE could separate the oxidation peak potentials of BPF
      and BPAF present in the same solution though, at the bare GCE, the peak
      potentials were indistinguishable. The results showed that the
      electrochemical sensor exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity
      towards the oxidation of the two analytes. The peak current in DPV of BPF
      and BPAF increased linearly with their concentration in the ranges of
      0.6-1.6 mmol/L BPF and 0.6-1.6 mmol/L BPAF. The detection limits were
      0.1243 mmol/L and 0.1742 mmol/L (S/N=3) correspondingly. The modified
      electrode was successfully used to simultaneously determine BPF and BPAF
      in real samples.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol F (BPF) as an endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) pollutant in
      the environment poses a great threat to human health. To evaluate the
      toxicity of BPF at the protein level, the effects of BPF on human serum
      albumin (HSA) were investigated at three temperatures 283, 298, and 308 K
      by multiple spectroscopic techniques. The experimental results showed that
      BPF effectively quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA via static
      quenching. The number of binding sites, the binding constant, the
      thermodynamic parameters and the binding subdomain were measured, and
      indicated that BPF could spontaneously bind with HSA on subdomain IIA
      through H-bond and van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, the
      conformation of HSA was demonstrably changed in the presence of BPF. The
      work provides accurate and full basic data for clarifying the binding
      mechanisms of BPF with HSA in vivo and is helpful for understanding its
      effect on protein function during its transportation and distribution in
      blood.

ABSTRACT:
      Three bacteria capable of utilizing bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane (bisphenol
      F [BPF]) as the sole carbon source were isolated from river water, and
      they all belonged to the family Sphingomonadaceae. One of the isolates,
      designated Sphingobium yanoikuyae strain FM-2, at an initial cell density
      of 0.01 (optical density at 600 nm) completely degraded 0.5 mM BPF within
      9 h without any lag period under inductive conditions. Degradation assays
      of various bisphenols revealed that the BPF-metabolizing system of strain
      FM-2 was effective only on the limited range of bisphenols consisting of
      two phenolic rings joined together through a bridging carbon without any
      methyl substitution on the rings or on the bridging structure. A BPF
      biodegradation pathway was proposed on the basis of metabolite production
      patterns and identification of the metabolites. The initial step of BPF
      biodegradation involves hydroxylation of the bridging carbon to form
      bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methanol, followed by oxidation to
      4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone. The 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone appears to be
      further oxidized by the Baeyer-Villiger reaction to 4-hydroxyphenyl
      4-hydroxybenzoate, which is then cleaved by oxidation to form
      4-hydroxybenzoate and 1,4-hydroquinone. Both of the resultant simple
      aromatic compounds are mineralized.

ABSTRACT:
      An accurate quantitative determination and confirmative method for
      bisphenol diglycidyl ether residues, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE),
      bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE), bisphenol A (2,3-dihydroxypropyl)
      glycidyl ether (BADGE H2O), bisphenol A bis (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether
      (BADGE x 2H2O), bisphenol A (3-chloro-2-hydroxy propyl)
      (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether (BADGE x H2O x HCl), bisphenol A
      (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) glycidyl ether (BADGE x HCl), bisphenol A
      bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) ether (BADGE x 2HCl), bisphenol F bis (2,
      3-dihydroxypropyl) ether (BFDGE x 2H2O), bisphenol F bis
      (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) ether (BFDGE x 2HCl) in canned foodstuffs by
      high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
      (HPLC-MS/MS) has been established. The sample was extracted with
      tert-butylmethyl ether and the extract was cleaned-up and concentrated on
      a Waters Oasis HLB column. The target compounds were analyzed by
      HPLC-MS/MS on a C18 column by the gradient elution with methanol and 5
      mmol/L ammonium acetate containing 0.1% formic acid in a multiple reaction
      monitoring (MRM) scan mode. External matrix standard solutions were used
      for the quantitative determination and the calibration curves showed good
      linearity in the concentration range of 10.0 -2 000.0 microg/L for the
      nine target compounds. The limits of quantification of the nine compounds
      were 10.0 microg/kg (S/N   >  or = 10). The average recoveries of the nine
      compounds ranged from 79.6% to 100.9% at the spiked levels of 10.0, 100.0,
      1 000.0 microg/kg with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of
      6.3%-12.1%. The method is sensitive, accurate, and suitable for the rapid
      determination of bisphenol diglycidyl ether residues in canned foodstuffs.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol F (BPF), an environmental estrogen, is used as a monomer in
      plastic industry and its environmental fate and decontamination are
      emerging concern. This study focused on the kinetics, influencing factors
      and pathways of its oxidation by MnO(2). At pH 5.5, about 90% of BPF was
      oxidized in 20 min in a solution containing 100 &mu;M MnO(2) and 4.4 &mu;M
      BPF. The reaction was pH-dependent, following an order of pH 4.5   >  pH
      5.5   >  pH 8.6   >  pH 7.5   >  pH 6.5   >  pH 9.6. Humic acids inhibited
      the reaction at low (&le; pH 5.5) and high pH (&ge; pH 8.6) at high
      concentrations. In addition, metal ions and anions also suppressed the
      reaction, following the order Mn(2+)   >  Ca(2+)   >  Mg(2+)   >  Na(+)
      and HPO(4)(2-)   >  Cl(-)   >  NO(3)(-) &asymp; SO(4)(2-), respectively. A
      total of 5 products were identified, from which a tentative pathway was
      proposed.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and bisphenol F diglycidyl ether
      (BFDGE) are used as starting substances for the manufacturing of epoxy
      resins used in internal can coatings. They are obtained by a condensation
      reaction between epichlorohydrin with bisphenol A and bisphenol F,
      respectively. These potential endocrine disrupting chemicals are able to
      enter the food chain and to reach the intestinal epithelium, causing
      structural and functional damages. The human colorectal adenocarcinoma
      cell line Caco-2 is a widely used in vitro model of the intestinal cells.
      The aim of this study was to characterize BADGE and BFDGE toxicity in
      Caco-2 cells, in particular, at the cellular and molecular level. Using
      several approaches, we characterized BADGE- and BFDGE-induced cell
      toxicity in Caco-2 cells. The treatment was done using different
      concentrations up to cytotoxic doses and different times of exposure to
      the agents. We evaluated the effect of these compounds on cell morphology,
      cell detachment, cell proliferation, F-actin disruption and plasma
      membrane integrity. Both compounds are able to induce morphological
      changes, cell detachment from the substratum and to inhibit cell
      proliferation, being these effects time and dose-dependent. Moreover,
      BADGE and BFDGE induce F-actin depolymerization, this effect is very
      potent at 24 h of incubation with the agents and a complete F-actin
      disruption can be observed at 200 microM BADGE or BFDGE. In addition, cell
      integrity is not damaged, since neither propidium iodide uptake nor LDH
      release takes place in Caco-2 cells exposed to high doses of these agents
      for 24 h.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol F (BPF) are widely used to manufacture
      plastics and epoxy resins. Both compounds have been shown to be present in
      the environment and are food contaminants, with, as a result, a low but
      chronic exposure of humans. However, the fate and possible bioactivation
      of these compounds at the level of human cell lines was not completely
      elucidated yet. In this study, we investigated the ability of human cells
      (intestinal cell line: LS174T, hepatoma cell line: HepG2, and renal cell
      line: ACHN) to biotransform BPA and BPF, and focused on the cytotoxicity
      and genotoxicity of these two bisphenols, through the use of a novel and
      efficient genotoxic assay based on the detection of histone H2AX
      phosphorylation. BPA and BPF were extensively metabolized in HepG2 and
      LS174T cell lines, with stronger biotransformation capabilities in
      intestinal cells than observed in liver cells. Both cell lines produced
      the glucuronide as well as the sulfate conjugates of BPA. Conversely, the
      ACHN cell line was found to be devoid of any metabolic capabilities for
      the two examined bisphenols. Cytotoxicity was tested for BPA, BPF, as well
      as one metabolite of BPF produced in vivo in rat, namely
      dihydroxybenzophenone (DHB). In the three cell lines used, we observed
      similar ranges of toxicity, with DHB being weakly cytotoxic, BPF
      exhibiting an intermediary cytotoxicity, and BPA being the most cytotoxic
      compound tested. BPA and DHB were not found to be genotoxic, whatever the
      cell line examined. BPF was clearly genotoxic in HepG2 cells. These
      results demonstrate that some human cell lines extensively metabolize
      bisphenols and establish the genotoxic potential of bisphenol F.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol F (BPF) is present in the environment and as a contaminant of
      food. Humans may, therefore, be exposed to BPF, and an assessment of this
      risk is required. BPF has been shown to have genotoxic and
      endocrine-disruptor properties in a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2),
      which is a model system for studies of xenobiotic toxicity. In this study,
      we investigated the ability of HepG2 cells to biotransform BPF, because
      metabolism may affect the observed effects of BPF, and we compared this
      metabolic capacity with that of human hepatocytes. Cells were incubated
      for 24 hours with [(3)H]-BPF. The culture medium was then concentrated and
      its metabolites were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography
      and identified by mass spectrometry. BPF was largely metabolized into the
      corresponding sulfate by the HepG2 cell line. BPF was metabolized into
      both sulfate and glucuronide by human hepatocytes, but with differences
      between individuals. The metabolism of BPF in both HepG2 cells and human
      hepatocytes suggests the existence of a detoxification pathway. Thus,
      these two cell models differ in metabolic capacity. It is, therefore, very
      important, when assessing the toxic effects of substances in vitro, to
      determine, in parallel, the biotransformation capacities of the model used
      to extrapolate in vivo.

ABSTRACT:
      A group of compounds structurally similar to bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane
      (bisphenol A, BPA) are called bisphenols (BPs), and some of them can
      partially replace BPA in industrial applications. The production and
      consumption of BPs other than BPA, especially those of
      bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane (bisphenol F, BPF) and
      bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone (bisphenol S, BPS), have increased recently,
      leading to their detection as contaminants in the aquatic environment. The
      three compounds tested 100% positive for estrus response in 1936 and
      concerns about their health risks have been increasing. Abundant data on
      degradation of bisphenols (BPs) has been published, but results for
      biodegradation of BPs in seawater are lacking. However, several research
      groups have focused on this topic recently. In this study, the
      biodegradation behaviors of three BPs, namely BPA, BPF and BPS, in
      seawater were investigated using TOC Handai (TOC, potential test) and
      river (sea) die-away (SDA, simulation test) methods, which are both a kind
      of river-die-away test. The main difference between the tests is that
      indigenous microcosms remain in the sampled raw seawater for the SDA
      experiments, but they are removed through filtration and dispersed into
      artificial seawater for the TOC experiments. The BPs, except for BPS, were
      degraded using both methods. The SDA method produced better biodegradation
      results than the TOC method in terms of degradation time (both lag and
      degradation periods). Biodegradation efficiencies were measured at 75-100%
      using the SDA method and 13-63% using the TOC method. BPF showed better
      degradation efficiency than BPA, BPF was   >  92% and BPA 83% depleted
      according to the SDA tests. BPS degradation was not observed. As a
      conclusion, the biodegradability of the three BPs in seawater could be
      ranked as BPF   >  BPA   >   >  BPS. BPF is more biodegradable than BPA in
      seawater and BPS is more likely to accumulate in the aquatic environment.
      BPS poses a lower risk to human health and to the environment than BPA or
      BPF but it is not amenable to biodegradation and might be persistent and
      become an ecological burden. Thus other degradation methods need to be
      found for the removal of BPS in the environment.

ABSTRACT:
      The distribution of bisphenol F (4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl-methane, BPF) was
      studied in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Pregnant and nonpregnant animals
      were gavaged with a single dose of 7 or 100 mg/kg [3H]BPF and were kept
      for 96 h in metabolic cages. The excretion of BPF residues occurred mainly
      in urine (43-54% of the administered dose), which was found to contain at
      least six different metabolites, and to a lesser extent in feces (15-20%
      of the administered dose). Sulfatase treatment and subsequent
      high-performance liquid chromatography analyses suggest that the major
      urinary metabolite (more than 50% of the radioactivity present in urine)
      is a sulfate conjugate of BPF. At 96 h, BPF residues were detectable in
      all tissues examined with the largest amounts in the liver (0.5% of the
      dose). In pregnant rats dosed at day 17 of gestation, BPF residues were
      detected in the uterus, placenta, amniotic fluid, and fetuses (0.9-1.3% of
      the administered dose). Large amounts of radioactivity (8-10% of the dose)
      were still located in the digestive tract lumen at the end of the study.
      After administration of a single oral dose of [3H]BPF, 46% of the
      distributed radioactivity was excreted in bile over a 6 h period. In rats,
      BPF and/or its metabolites very likely undergo enterohepatic cycling,
      which could be responsible for the relatively high amounts of residues
      still excreted 4 days after BPF administration. This bisphenol is
      efficiently absorbed and distributed to the reproductive tract in female
      rats, and its residues pass the placental barrier at a late stage of
      gestation in rats.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol F [4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl-methane] (BPF) has a broad range of
      applications in industry (liners lacquers, adhesives, plastics, coating of
      drinks and food cans). Free monomers of this bisphenol can be released
      into the environment and enter the food chain, very likely resulting in
      the exposure of humans to low doses of BPF. This synthetic compound has
      been reported to be estrogenic. A study of BPF distribution and metabolism
      in rats has demonstrated the formation of many metabolites, with multiple
      biotransformation pathways. In the present work we investigated the in
      vitro biotransformation of radio-labelled BPF using rat and human liver
      subcellular fractions. BPF metabolites were separated, isolated by
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and analysed by mass
      spectrometry (MS), MS(n), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Many of
      these metabolites were characterized for the first time in mammals and in
      humans. BPF is metabolised into the corresponding glucuronide and sulfate
      (liver S9 fractions). In addition to these phase II biotransformation
      products, various hydroxylated metabolites are formed, as well as
      structurally related apolar metabolites. These phase I metabolic pathways
      are dominant for incubations carried out with liver microsomes and also
      present for incubations carried out with liver S9 fractions. The formation
      of the main metabolites, namely meta-hydroxylated BPF and
      ortho-hydroxylated BPF (catechol BPF) is P450 dependent, as is the
      formation of the less polar metabolites characterized as BPF dimers. Both
      the formation of a catechol and of dimeric metabolites correspond to
      biotransformation pathways shared by BPF, other bisphenols and estradiol.

      B, bisphenol F diglycidyl ether, and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, was
      monitored in commercial milk packed in plastic bottles marketed in Italy.
      The new validated method includes a solid-phase extraction procedure
      followed by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. All
      positive results were confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry analysis. The limits of detection and quantification and the
      recovery percentages indicated that the method is suitable for detecting
      bisphenols in milk at concentrations far below the legal limits. Of 68
      commercial milk samples analyzed, no bisphenol was found in 27 samples
      (39.7%), and 41 samples (60.3%) contained one or more bisphenols. The
      bisphenol most frequently found was bisphenol F (36 samples, 52.9%)
      followed by bisphenol A (20 samples, 29.4%) and bisphenol B (6 samples,
      8.8%). Taking into consideration the limits of detection, no sample
      contained either bisphenol F diglycidyl ether or bisphenol A diglycidyl
      ether.

ABSTRACT:ACT:
      Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) is the monomer and main allergen
      in the most common epoxy resin, DGEBA-R. Epoxy resin(s) based on bisphenol
      F (DGEBF-R) contains the 3 isomers of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F.
      Contact allergy to these isomers (p,p'-DGEBF, o,p'-DGEBF and o,o'-DGEBF)
      has not previously been described in humans. To investigate contact
      allergies to the DGEBF isomers in patients with contact allergy to
      DGEBF-R, 9 patients were patch-tested with dilution series of the isomers.
      All 9 were found to have contact allergy to p,p'-DGEBF and 7/9 to
      o,p'-DGEBF. Additionally, of 20 workers employed in epoxy-based
      manufacture and with contact allergy to DGEBA-R and DGEBF-R, 18 reacted to
      p,p'-DGEBF and 15/20 to o,p'-DGEBF. According to a guinea pig maximization
      test, all 3 DGEBF isomers are strong sensitizers. Still, o,o'-DGEBF
      elicited only 3 positive reactions in all participants.

ABSTRACT:
      A reliable and sensitive method for simultaneous determination of
      bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol F (BPF) in canned food by gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is described after extraction and
      pre-concentration by a new solid-phase microextraction (SPME) adsorbent.
      The potential of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as SPME adsorbent
      for the pre-concentration of environmental contaminants has been
      investigated in recent years. This work was carried out to investigate the
      feasibility of SWCNTs as a headspace SPME adsorbent for the determination
      of bisphenol derivatives in canned food. Potential factors affecting the
      extraction efficiency, including extraction time, extraction temperature,
      desorption time, desorption temperature, and salinity were optimized.
      Calibration curves were linear (r(2)  >  or = 0.994) over the
      concentration range from 0.30 to 60 microg kg(-1). For both target
      analytes, the limit of detection (LOD) at signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3
      was 0.10 microg kg(-1). In addition, a comparative study between the SWCNT
      and a commercial polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) SPME fibre for the
      determination of bisphenol derivatives in canned food was conducted. SWCNT
      fibre showed higher extraction capacity, better thermal stability (over
      350 degrees C) and longer life span (over 150 times) than the commercial
      PDMS fibre. The method was successfully applied to determine BPA in canned
      food samples which were purchased from local markets. BPA was found in
      some of the samples within the concentration range from 0.5 to 5.2 microg
      kg(-1).

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND: Epoxy resins based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F (DGEBF)
      are widely used as such in applications requiring chemical resistance, and
      also together with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A resin (DGEBA-R).
      Concomitant patch test reactions to DGEBA-R and DGEBF resin (DGEBF-R) are
      common. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results on the frequency
      of independent DGEBF-R contact allergies.

      OBJECTIVES: To report the results of over 11 years of screening with
      DGEBF-R.

      METHODS: An in-house test substance of DGEBF-R (Epikote 862) was tested in
      the baseline patch test series, first at 1% and later at 0.25%. Test files
      were screened for allergic reactions to DGEBF-R and DGEBA-R, and the
      clinical records of positively reacting patients were analysed for
      occupation and exposure.

      RESULTS: Among 1972 patients, 66 (3.3%) reacted to DGEBF-R and 96 (4.9%)
      to DGEBA-R. Independent DGEBF-R allergies were seen in 5 patients only,
      and independent DGEBA-R allergies in 35. Specific exposure to DGEBF-R was
      found in 26 patients. The main occupational fields were the aircraft
      industry, the electrical and sports equipment industry, boat building,
      painting/floor coating, tile setting, and pipe relining.

      CONCLUSIONS: Independent contact allergies to DGEBF-R were rare, and
      screening with it was not found to be useful.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely studied typical endocrine-disrupting
      chemical, and one of the major new issues is the safe replacement of this
      commonly used compound. Bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) are
      already or are planned to be used as BPA alternatives. With the use of a
      culture system that we developed (fetal testis assay [FeTA]), we
      previously showed that 10 nmol/L BPA reduces basal testosterone secretion
      of human fetal testis explants and that the susceptibility to BPA is at
      least 100-fold lower in rat and mouse fetal testes. Here, we show that
      addition of LH in the FeTA system considerably enhances BPA minimum
      effective concentration in mouse and human but not in rat fetal testes.
      Then, using the FeTA system without LH (the experimental conditions in
      which mouse and human fetal testes are most sensitive to BPA), we found
      that, as for BPA, 10 nmol/L BPS or BPF is sufficient to decrease basal
      testosterone secretion by human fetal testes with often nonmonotonic
      dose-response curves. In fetal mouse testes, the dose-response curves were
      mostly monotonic and the minimum effective concentrations were 1,000
      nmol/L for BPA and BPF and 100 nmol/L for BPS. Finally, 10,000 nmol/L BPA,
      BPS, or BPF reduced Insl3 expression in cultured mouse fetal testes. This
      is the first report describing BPS and BPF adverse effects on a
      physiologic function in humans and rodents.

ABSTRACT:
      In this study, we tested and compared the endocrine disruption activities
      of compounds in materials used to package foods (bisphenol A, bisphenol F,
      and bisphenol A diglycidylether BADGE) with natural molecules (genistein,
      apigenin, kaempferol, and tangeretin) in the human breast cancer cell
      lines MCF-7 (ER(+)) and MDA-MB453 (AR(+); GR(+)). Octylphenol was also
      chosen as a xenoestrogen reference. Two compounds had no estrogenic
      activity: BADGE and tangeretin. Genistein was the most active compound in
      the E-Screen assay with MCF-7, followed by octylphenol, bisphenol F,
      bisphenol A and apigenin, with kaempferol the least potent. All estrogenic
      compounds competed with 17beta-estradiol for binding to the MCF-7 ER and
      their estrogenic effects were abolished in the presence of tamoxifen, an
      ER antagonist. In MDA-MB453 cells transfected with pMMTVneo-Luc, all
      compounds had anti-androgenic activities, with octylphenol the most
      potent. Kaempferol, genistein, and apigenin were more potent
      anti-androgens than bisphenols A or F. The natural compounds had a
      biphasic effect on luciferase activity. At high concentrations, genistein
      (10(-5)M) and apigenin (10(-6)M) acted as GR agonists in transfected
      MDA-MB453 cells. Furthermore, apigenin, at a concentration of 10(-5)M, may
      act as a partial androgen receptor (AR) agonist, as nilutamide, an AR
      antagonist, inhibited its activity by 26%.

ABSTRACT:
      Unpolymerized dental monomers can leach out into the oral biophase and are
      bioavailable for metabolism. We hypothesize that metabolites would be less
      toxic than parent monomers. We first identified the formation of
      metabolites from bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) and Bisphenol A
      glycidyl methacrylate (BISGMA) after their exposure to liver S9 fractions.
      Then, the metabolites and parent compounds were subjected to in vitro
      cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and estrogenicity studies. Bisphenol A
      bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether and bisphenol F bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)
      ether were the hydroxylated metabolites of BISGMA and BFDGE, respectively.
      Cytotoxicity against L929 cells showed that the metabolites were
      significantly (p   <  0.05) less cytotoxic than the parent monomers. Only
      BFDGE was mutagenic in the Ames assay with strain TA100 of Salmonella
      typhimurium. Parent and metabolite compounds did not stimulate
      estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cell proliferation above solvent controls. These
      results indicated that the hydroxylated metabolites were non-mutagenic,
      non-estrogenic, and less cytotoxic than their parent monomers.

ABSTRACT:
      Migration of potentially toxic materials used for the lining of commercial
      can goods remains an important issue, especially with respect to certain
      types of processed foods. Seafood is one type where more information is
      needed with respect to other ingredients used for adding value to fishery
      products. Most cans are internally coated with starters of resins such as
      bisphenol A diglycidyl-ether (BADGE) and bisphenol F diglycidyl-ether
      (BFDGE), both considered as toxic compounds. Several seafood products,
      sardines, tuna fish, mackerel, mussels, cod and mackerel eggs, were
      manufactured in different conditions changing covering sauce, time and
      temperature of storage and heat-treated for sterilization in cans.
      Migration kinetics of BADGE and BFDGE from varnish into canned products
      were evaluated by HPLC in 70 samples after 6, 12 or 18 months of storage.
      Results showed that there is no migration of BADGE in tuna fish, sardines,
      mussels or cod. However, migration of BFDGE occurs in all species, in a
      storage time-dependent way and content of fat, although migration of these
      compounds is not affected by sterilization conditions. All samples
      analyzed presented values lower than 9 mg BADGE/kg net product without
      exceeding European limits. However, concerning BFDGE migration, European
      legislation does not allow the use and/or the presence of BFDGE. Main
      migration takes place in mackerel reaching the highest values, 0.74 mg
      BFDGE/kg and 0.34 mg BADGE/kg net product, in red pepper sauce.

ABSTRACT:
      A 30-year-old man presented with eyelid dermatitis and was diagnosed with
      occupational allergic contact dermatitis to an epoxy resin based on the
      monomer diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F. He did not react to the standard
      epoxy resin based on bisphenol A, but reacted to a diluted sample of epoxy
      resin taken from his workplace, an adhesives manufacturing plant. The
      diagnosis would not have been made had he not brought samples from work,
      which were patch tested after appropriate dilution. The material safety
      data sheet provided additional evidence that the epoxy was not based on
      bisphenol A. The patient's symptoms subsided after avoidance of the
      identified product.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol F (BPF) have been determined in a range of
      canned foods. Sixty-two different canned foods were purchased from retail
      outlets in the UK from January to November 2000 and the contents extracted
      and analysed by GC-MS for BPA and BPF isomers. The following canned
      products were analysed: fish in aqueous media, 10 samples; vegetables, 10;
      beverages, 11; soup, 10; desserts, five; fruit, two; infant formula, four;
      pasta, five; and meat products, five. BPF isomers were not detected in any
      of the canned foods with detection limits of 0.005 mg kg(-1) for the 2,2'
      and 2,4' isomers and 0.01 mg kg(-1) for the 4,4' isomer. BPA was detected
      in 38 samples with a detection limit of 0.002 mg kg(-1). Of these, BPA was
      quantified in 37 canned foods at levels from 0.007 mg kg(-1), with one
      sample of meat containing a mean level of 0.38 mg kg(-1). All other
      samples contained   < 0.07 mg kg(-1) BPA.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) is well known for its use in plastic manufacture and
      thermal paper production despite its risk of health toxicity as an
      endocrine disruptor in humans. Since the publication of new legislation
      regarding the use of BPA, manufacturers have begun to replace BPA with
      other phenolic molecules such as bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol B (BPB),
      but there are no guarantees regarding the health safety of these compounds
      at this time. In this context, a very simple, cheap and fast
      surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method was developed for the
      sensitive detection of these molecules in spiked tap water solutions.
      Silver nanoparticles were used as SERS substrates. An original strategy
      was employed to circumvent the issue of the affinity of bisphenols for
      metallic surfaces and the silver nanoparticles surface was functionalized
      using pyridine in order to improve again the sensitivity of the detection.
      Semi-quantitative detections were performed in tap water solutions at a
      concentrations range from 0.25 to 20 &mu;g L(-1) for BPA and BPB and from
      5 to 100 &mu;g L(-1) for BPF. Moreover, a feasibility study for performing
      a multiplex-SERS detection of these molecules was also performed before
      successfully implementing the developed SERS method on real samples.

ABSTRACT:
      A method based on solid-phase extraction followed by HPLC analysis with
      fluorescence detection was developed for the determination of bisphenol A
      diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) in
      liquid infant formula. In this method, instead of trying to isolate and
      measure each individual form of the molecules, hydrolysis of BADGE, BFDGE,
      BADGE x H2O, and BFDGE x H2O was forced to completion to their stable
      forms, BADGE x 2H2O and BFDGE x 2H2O, before extraction. The method LODs
      were 2.0 ng/g for BADGE and 3.0 ng/g for BFDGE. Extraction recoveries were
      61-91% for BADGE, and 55-82% for BFDGE over the concentration range of 10
      to 50 ng/g. The method was used to analyze samples of 21 canned liquid
      infant formula products for BADGE and BFDGE. BADGE was detected in samples
      of all products at levels ranging from as low as 2.4 ng/g to as high as
      262 ng/g. BFDGE was detected in only one product (40 ng/g), and this
      product also had the highest BADGE level (262 ng/g). HPLC/MS/MS with a
      similar LOD was also used to confirm the results. The probable daily
      intakes (PDI) of BADGE and BFDGE due to consumption of canned liquid
      infant formula were estimated for infants from premature to 12-18 months
      of age. The maximum PDI of BADGE was 22 microg/kg body weight/day for the
      12-18 months old with the maximum formula intake. The maximum PDI of BFDGE
      was   <  3.4 microg/kg body weight/day.

ABSTRACT:
      Despite the widespread use of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and
      bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) in various consumer products, studies
      on human exposure to these compounds are scarce. In this study, BADGE,
      BFDGE, and seven of their derivatives were determined in human adipose fat
      and blood plasma samples collected from New York City, NY. Bisphenol A bis
      (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether [BADGE&middot;2H2O] was the major BADGE
      derivative found in 60% of the adipose samples and 70% of the plasma
      samples analyzed. High concentrations and detection frequencies of BFDGE
      were found in both adipose and plasma samples. BFDGE concentrations in
      adipose fat ranged from 19.1 to 4500 ng/g wet weight. A significant
      correlation between BADGE or BFDGE and their derivatives in adipose and
      plasma samples suggested hydration of these reactive compounds in humans.
      A significant positive correlation existed between BADGEs (i.e., the sum
      of BADGE and its five derivatives) and BFDGEs in adipose samples, which
      suggested similar exposure sources and pathways for these compounds in
      humans. Bisphenol A (BPA) also was analyzed in adipose fat and plasma, and
      its concentrations were positively correlated with those of BADGEs, which
      confirmed coexposure of BADGEs and BPA in humans.

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND: Early-life exposure to the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A
      (BPA) affects brain function and behavior, which might be attributed to
      its interference with hormonal steroid signaling and/or neurotransmitter
      systems. Alternatively, the use of structural analogs of BPA, mainly
      bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS), has increased recently. However,
      limited in vivo toxicity data exist.

      OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of BPA, BPF and BPS on
      5&alpha;-reductase (5&alpha;-R), a key enzyme involved in
      neurosteroidogenesis, as well as on dopamine (DA)- and serotonin
      (5-HT)-related genes, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of juvenile female
      rats.

      METHODS: Gestating Wistar rats were treated with either vehicle or 10
      &mu;g/kg/day of BPA, BPF or BPS from gestational day 12 to parturition.
      Then, female pups were exposed from postnatal day 1 through day 21
      (PND21), when they were euthanized and RT-PCR, western blot and
      quantitative PCR-array experiments were performed.

      RESULTS: BPA decreased 5&alpha;-R2 and 5&alpha;-R3 mRNA and protein
      levels, while both BPF and BPS decreased 5&alpha;-R3 mRNA levels in PFC at
      PND21. Further, BPA, BPF and BPS significantly altered, respectively, the
      transcription of 25, 56 and 24 genes out of the 84 DA and 5-HT-related
      genes assayed. Of particular interest was the strong induction by all
      these bisphenols of Cyp2d4, implicated in corticosteroids synthesis.

      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate for the first time that BPA, BPF and
      BPS differentially affect 5&alpha;-R and genes related to DA/5-HT systems
      in the female PFC. In vivo evidence of the potential adverse effects of
      BPF and BPS in the brain of mammals is provided in this work, raising
      questions about the safety of these chemicals as substitutes for BPA.

ABSTRACT:
      The combined effect of environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) is one of
      the hottest topics. The estrogenic activities of BPA, BPAF, BPAP, BPF were
      tested based on recombinant gene yeast assay. Six mixtures were designed
      based on the result of the test,each of which had an equitoxic ratio ray
      (EC10 or EC50). The EC50 values are 6.81 x 10(-6) mol x L(-1), 7.44 x
      10(-7) mol x L(-1), 1.43 x 10(-5) mol x L(-1), 7.52 x 10(-6) mol x L(-1)
      for BPA, BPAF, BPAP and BPF respectively,which reveals that the estrogenic
      activities order among the four bisphenols was BPAF  >  BPA  >  BPF  > 
      BPAP. The experiment shows that when BPA mixes with BPAF, BPAP and BPF in
      different ratios individually, different combination effects are produced.
      It reveals that the combined ratios of the components may affect the
      combined effect. The dose addition model and the independent action model
      are used to identify the combined effect. They are testified to be more
      intuitionistic and more comprehensive than other joint effect indices.

ABSTRACT:
      Epoxy coatings are commonly used to protect the interior (and exterior)
      surfaces of water mains and storage tanks and can be used on the interior
      surfaces of water pipes in homes, hospitals, hotels, and other buildings.
      Common major components of epoxies include bisphenols, such as bisphenol A
      (BPA) or bisphenol F (BPF), and their reactive prepolymers, bisphenol A
      diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE),
      respectively. There currently are health concerns about the safety of BPA
      and BPF due to known estrogenic effects. Determination of key bisphenol
      leachates, development of a hydrolysis model, and identification of stable
      hydrolysis products will aid in assessment of human bisphenol exposure
      through ingestion of drinking water. Liquid chromatography/mass
      spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) was used for quantitation of key analytes, and a
      pseudo-first order kinetic approach was used for modeling. In
      fill-and-dump studies on epoxy-coated pipe specimens, BADGE and a BPA-like
      compound were identified as leachates. The BADGE hydrolysis model predicts
      BADGE half-lives at pH 7 and 15, 25, 35, and 40      &deg;C to be 11, 4.6,
      2.0, and 1.4 days respectively; the BFDGE half-life was 5 days at pH 7 and
      25      &deg;C. The two identified BADGE hydrolysis products are BADGE-H2O
      and BADGE 2H2O, with BADGE 2H2O being the final end product under the
      conditions studied.

ABSTRACT:
      Due to the regulation on bisphenol A (BPA) in several industrialized
      countries, the demand for other bisphenol analogues (BPs) as substitutes
      for BPA is growing. Eight BPs were determined in sludge from 40
      representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Korea. Total
      concentrations of BPs (&Sigma;BP) in sludge ranged from   < LOQ to 25700
      ng g(-1). The highest concentrations of &Sigma;BP were found in sludge
      collected from WWTPs that received discharges from the paper and textile
      industries. The profiles of BPs were dependent on the proportions of
      industrial wastewater treated at each of the WWTPs. The sludge from
      industrial WWTPs contained elevated proportions of BPA, whereas sludge
      from domestic WWTPs was dominated by bisphenol F (BPF), suggesting use of
      BPF in certain industrial products in Korea. No significant correlations
      were found between BPs and the WWTP characteristics. The average
      per-capita emissions of BPs ranged from 0.04 (BPP) to 886 g capita(-1) d
      (BPA) through WWTP discharges. The emission fluxes of &Sigma;BP through
      industrial WWTPs were 2-3 orders of magnitudes higher than those
      calculated for domestic WWTPs, indicating that industrial discharges are
      the major source of BPs into the Korean environment. This is the first
      nationwide survey of BPs in sludge from Korean WWTPs.

ABSTRACT:
      An outbreak of suspected contact dermatitis among subway construction
      workers was suspected to be due to a new bisphenol A/F-based epoxy resin
      system (ERS). The construction workers used ERSs during the insertion of
      iron bars into concrete walls. The objective of the study was to determine
      the components (if any) of the ERS responsible for the contact allergy.
      Patch testing was performed on 20 of the 22 construction workers who had
      had contact with the ERS, and to the various subcomponents of component A
      on 5 of the 7 who reacted to this component. 9 patients (9/22, 40.9%) had
      clinical symptoms and signs of suspected contact dermatitis at
      presentation. 7 of these 9, but none of the 11 asymptomatic individuals,
      were positive to component A, while all were negative to component B. Of
      the 5 cases receiving further patch testing, all reacted to m-xylylene
      diamine, 4 to 1,6-hexanediol diglycidyl ether, 3 to epoxy resins of the
      bisphenol F-type and trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether 0.25%
      petrolatum, and only 1 to epoxy resins of the bisphenol A-type. Contact
      allergy to ERSs may involve hardeners and diluents as well as resins, and
      patch testing for reaction to all components should be performed.

ABSTRACT:
      We studied in vitro hormonal activity of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether
      (BADGE) and bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE), which are used as a
      material of interior coating for food cans. We also examined related
      compounds such as 2,2-bis[4-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]propane
      (BADGE.2HCl), and bis[4-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]methane
      (BFDGE.2HCl) etc. For this purpose, we constructed two stably transfected
      CHO-K1 cell lines (AR-EcoScreen for androgenic activity and c-luc for cell
      toxicity evaluation). One stably expresses luciferase with induction of
      androgen. The other stably expresses luciferase without androgen
      induction. Also, we have determined the androgenic and anti-androgenic
      effects of the test chemicals by reporter gene assay with these cell
      lines. None of the chemicals tested by this assay exhibited androgen
      agonistic activity. However, BADGE.2HCl and BFDGE.2HCl had the conspicuous
      antagonistic activity for androgen. These compounds had a high binding
      affinity for androgen receptor. Furthermore, these two compounds did not
      show the estrogenic activity in vitro assays. On the contrary, bisphenol A
      and bisphenol F exhibited anti-androgenic activity in vitro in addition to
      the estrogenic activity. These results suggest that these chlorohydroxy
      compounds of BADGE and BFDGE act as androgen antagonist through the
      process of binding to androgen receptor.

ABSTRACT:
      A simple and highly sensitive electroanalytical method for the
      determination of bisphenol F (BPF) was developed, which was carried out on
      multi-walled carbon nanotubes-COOH (MWCNT-COOH) modified glassy carbon
      electrode (GCE) using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse
      voltammetry (DPV). The results showed that MWCNT-COOH remarkably enhanced
      the oxidation of BPF, which improved the anodic peak current of BPF
      significantly. The mechanism was oxidation of BPF lose electrons on the
      electrode surface via adsorption-controlled process, electrode reaction is
      the two electrons/two protons process. Under the optimised conditions, the
      oxidation peak current was proportional to BPF concentration the range
      from 0.12 to 6.01 &mu;g mL(-1). The detection limit was 0.11 &mu;g mL(-1)
      (S/N=3), and the relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) was 3.5% (n=9).
      Moreover, the MWCNT-COOH/GCE electrode showed good reproducibility,
      stability and anti-interference. Therefore, the proposed method was
      successfully applied to determine BPF in food packing and the results were
      satisfactory.

ABSTRACT:
      The epoxy resin bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE), was examined for its
      mutagenicity in prokaryotic assays (Salmonella typhimurium His(-) and
      Escherichia coli Trp(-) tests) and its genotoxicity in eukaryotic systems
      (sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus tests in human
      lymphocytes), in the presence or absence of an exogenous metabolizing
      system (S9 from rat liver). In the prokaryotic tests, the concentrations
      of BFDGE ranged between 100 and 5000 micro g per plate, and in the
      eukaryotic assays from 12.5 to 62.5 micro g/ml. The compound is able to
      induce mutagenic effects in bacterial strains TA100, TA1535, WP2uvrA and
      IC3327, as revealed by the increase observed in the number of induced
      revertants. With respect to the genotoxicity assays, BFDGE induces an
      increase in the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei in
      human peripheral blood lymphocytes.

ABSTRACT:
      There are only a few studies that have assessed the effect of bisphenol A
      (BPA) on human blood cells and no study has been conducted to analyze the
      impact of BPA analogs on human leucocytes. In this study, we have
      investigated the effect of BPA and its analogs like bisphenol F (BPF),
      bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol AF (BPAF) on apoptosis induction in human
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In order to clarify the
      mechanism of bisphenols-induced programmed cell death, changes in various
      signaling molecules of this process have been assessed. We observed an
      increase in cytosolic calcium ions (Ca(2+)) level and reduction of
      transmembrane mitochondrial potential (&Delta;&Psi;m) in PBMCs incubated
      with all compounds examined, and particularly BPA and BPAF. All compounds
      studied changed PBMCs membrane permeability, activated caspase-8, -9, -3
      and induced PARP-1 cleavage and chromatin condensation, which confirmed
      that they were capable of inducing apoptosis both via intrinsic and
      extrinsic pathway. Moreover, we have found that modus operandi of
      bisphenols studied was different. We noticed that BPAF and BPS caused
      mainly necrotic and apoptotic changes, respectively, whereas BPA induced
      comparable apoptotic and necrotic effects in the incubated cells.

ABSTRACT:
      Production of bisphenol A (BPA) analogues such as bisphenol F (BPF) and
      bisphenol AF (BPAF) has recently increased, due to clear evidence of
      adverse effects of BPA on humans and wildlife. Bisphenols (BPs) have
      already been released into aquatic environment without previous available
      information about potential adverse effects of BPs and their potential
      risk to aquatic ecosystems. In this study, lethal and sublethal effects of
      BPF and BPAF to bacteria, algae, crustacea and fish embryos were
      investigated and the results were compared to the adverse effects obtained
      for BPA. We found that BPAF was the most toxic compound to Daphnia magna,
      Danio rerio and Desmodesmus subspicatus; the lowest 72      h EC50 (median
      effective concentration) and 21      d NOEC (no observed effect
      concentration) values were determined at 2.2      mg/L regarding zebrafish
      hatching success and 0.23      mg/L of BPAF obtained for growth and
      reproduction of water fleas, respectively. In most cases, BPA was more
      toxic to D.      magna, D.      rerio and D.      subspicatus in
      comparison to BPF, but pigmentation of zebrafish embryos after 48      h
      of exposure and reproduction of water fleas after 21-day D.      magna
      reproductive test exposure to BPF were much more impaired. Risk quotients
      (measured environmental concentration/21      d NOEC) showed that BPA, BPF
      and BPAF are recently not chronically hazardous to the survival,
      reproduction and growth of water fleas in surface waters. On the other
      hand, we importantly show that currently present BPAF concentrations in
      surface waters could cause a potential ecological risk to aquatic
      organisms. In the near future, higher concentrations of BPF and BPAF in
      surface waters are anticipated and for this reason further testing using
      test systems with various aquatic species and endpoints are needed to
      provide additional information about toxic impacts of BPF and BPAF on
      aquatic biota.

ABSTRACT:
      Diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and bisphenol F (DGEBF) are
      widely used as components in epoxy resin thermosetting products. They are
      known to cause occupational and nonoccupational allergic contact
      dermatitis. The aim of this study is to investigate analogues of DGEBF
      with regard to contact allergy and cytotoxicity. A comprehensive knowledge
      of the structural features that contribute to the allergenic and cytotoxic
      effects of DGEBF will guide the development of future novel epoxy resin
      systems with reduced health hazards for those coming into contact with
      them. It was found that the allergenic effects of DGEBF were dependent on
      its terminal epoxide groups. In contrast, it was found that the
      cytotoxicity in monolayer cell culture was dependent not only on the
      presence of epoxide groups but also on other structural features.

ABSTRACT:ACT:
      BACKGROUND: Simultaneous contact allergies to the reactive diluent phenyl
      glycidyl ether (PGE) and epoxy resins based on diglycidyl ether of
      bisphenol A (DGEBA) or epoxy resins of the bisphenol F-type have been
      reported. The latter epoxy resins contain three isomers of diglycidyl
      ether of bisphenol F (DGEBF). PGE, DGEBA, and DGEBF are chemically similar
      with respect to the reactive glycidyl group and an aromatic ring, making
      cross-reactivity one of the possible explanations to simultaneous
      reactions.

      AIM: To investigate the sensitizing capacity of PGE and the
      cross-reactivity of PGE versus the epoxy resin monomers DGEBA and the
      three DGEBF monomers and vice versa.

      METHOD: The guinea-pig maximization test.

      RESULTS: PGE is a strong sensitizer. Induction with DGEBA resulted in a
      statistically significant number of animals reacting to PGE, but when
      induced with PGE, the animals did not react significantly to DGEBA.

      CONCLUSIONS: When the results are applied to humans, it can be assumed
      that patients sensitized primarily to DGEBA react to PGE, but when
      sensitized exclusively to PGE, they do not react to DGEBA. Both reactive
      diluents and epoxy resins should be tested when contact allergy to epoxy
      resin systems are suspected.

ABSTRACT:
      While bisphenol F (BPF) has been frequently detected in various
      environmental compartments, limited information is available on its effect
      on thyroid endocrine system. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio)
      embryos were exposed to 0.2, 2, 20, and 200 &mu;g/L of BPF from 2 h
      post-fertilization (hpf) to 144 hpf. The whole-body content of thyroid
      hormones, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and transcription of genes
      belonging to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were
      investigated. BPF exposure resulted in alterations of both T3 and T4
      contents, increased the ratios of T3/T4, demonstrating thyroid endocrine
      disruption. Moreover, TSH content was significantly induced in a
      concentration-dependent manner after exposure to BPF. The increased gene
      transcription of dio2 might assist to degrade increased T3 contents.
      Treatment with BPF also significantly increased transcription of genes
      involved in thyroid hormone regulation (crh) and synthesis (nis and tg) as
      a compensatory mechanism for the decrease of T4 contents. However, the
      gene encoding protein involved in TH transport (ttr) was transcriptionally
      significantly down-regulated after exposure to BPF. Taken together, these
      results suggest that BPF alters the transcription of genes involved in the
      HPT axis as well as changes whole-body contents of thyroid hormones and
      TSH in zebrafish embryos/larvae, thus causing an endocrine disruption of
      the thyroid system.

ABSTRACT:
      This study examines 39 cases of sensitization to epoxy resin referred to
      the dermatology department of a Spanish university hospital during the
      period 2003-2007. The prevalence of epoxy resin sensitization was 2% and
      the mean sensitization period 24 months. The most frequent location was
      the hands (84% of patients). All cases reacted positively to bisphenol F
      patch tests. Sensitization to epoxy resins was the cause of a change in
      workplace for 46% of the cases. Other findings are discussed.

ABSTRACT:
      The reaction kinetics and transformation pathways between bisphenol F
      (BPF) and sodium hypochlorite were investigated at pH values ranging from
      6.5 to 8.5 and with different initial concentration ratios. The reaction
      rate was pH- and free available chlorine (FAC)-dependent: the reaction
      rate at pH 8.5 was almost 10 times than that at pH 6.5. A total of 40
      compounds were tentatively identified as chloro-substituted BPF and
      polyphenolic compounds by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight
      mass spectrometry operating in electrospray ionization mode
      (LC-ESI-Q-ToF), and 4 main byproducts were confirmed by 1H and 13C nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR). Toxicity tests indicated that the estrogenic
      effects of chloro-substituted BPF decrease as the chlorine substitution
      increase. On the contrary, increasing numbers of chlorines on the phenolic
      rings of BPF enhanced the nuclear receptor peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&gamma;) activity.
      Tetra-chlorinated BPF had an approximately 6.9-fold higher activity than
      BPF.

ABSTRACT:
      BPF (Bisphenol-F), a member of the bisphenol family, having a wide range
      of industrial applications is gradually replacing Bisphenol-A. It is a
      recognized endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). EDCs have been implicated
      in increased incidences of breast, prostate and testis cancers besides
      diabetes, obesity and decreased fertility. Due to the adverse effects of
      EDCs on human health, attempts have been directed towards their mechanism
      of toxicity especially at the molecular level. Hence, to understand the
      mechanism at the DNA level, interaction of BPF with calf thymus DNA was
      studied employing multi-spectroscopic, voltammetric and molecular docking
      techniques. Fluorescence spectra, cyclic voltammetry (CV), circular
      dichroism (CD) and molecular docking studies of BPF with DNA were
      suggestive of minor groove binding of BPF. UV-visible absorption and
      fluorescence spectra suggested static quenching due to complex formation
      between BPF and ctDNA. Hoechst 33258 (HO) and ethidium bromide (EB)
      displacement studies further confirmed such mode of BPF interaction.
      Thermodynamic and molecular docking parameters revealed the mechanism of
      binding of BPF with ctDNA to be favorable and spontaneous due to negative
      &Delta;G and occurring through hydrogen bonds and van der waals
      interactions. BPF induced DNA cleavage under in      vitro conditions by
      plasmid nicking assay suggested it to be genotoxic.

ABSTRACT:
      Although the increasing prevalence of thyroid nodular disease (TND) has
      been partially attributed to the more frequent usage of improved
      diagnostics, environmental factors, such as exposures to
      thyroid-disrupting chemicals may contribute to TND and altered thyroid
      function. We investigated the association between exposures to bisphenol A
      (BPA), its chlorinated derivatives (ClxBPA), and bisphenol F (BPF) with
      TND and thyroid measures in adult women. A case-control study in Cyprus
      and Romania (n = 212) was conducted, where cases were those with thyroid
      nodules (diameter   > 3mm), and controls without nodules. Serum TSH and
      free thyroxine and urinary levels of BPA, BPF and ClxBPA were measured
      using immunoassays and tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The
      association between exposures to BPA compounds and TND, adjusting for age,
      BMI, thyroid hormones and urinary iodine was assessed using logistic
      regression. Linear regression was used to explore associations between
      urinary BPA, BPF and ClxBPA and serum thyroid hormones. With the exception
      of a chlorinated BPA compound (30%), the rest of bisphenols were
      quantified in 100% of urine samples. A positive and significant
      (p  < 0.05) association was observed between urinary BPA and serum TSH
      that remained after adjusting for urinary creatinine, age, BMI, study site
      and disease status; there was no significant association between BPF or
      ClxBPA with TSH. None of the BPA compounds were associated with higher
      odds of TND. Our study found associations of urinary BPA with TSH but not
      with BPF or ClxBPA. A larger study would be justified.

ABSTRACT:
      The plastic component bisphenol A (BPA) is suspected to exert deleterious
      effects towards human health and targets various cellular and molecular
      pathways, including activity of ATP-binding cassette drug transporters.
      The present study was designed to determine whether BPA and some
      derivatives, like its substitutes bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS)
      and the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), may additionally
      interact with solute carrier (SLC) drug transporters. Activities of the
      various following SLC transporters were inhibited in a major way (by
        > 60%) by 100&mu;M bisphenols: OCT1 and MATE1 (by BPA and TBBPA),
      OATP1B1 (by BPA, BPF and TBBPA), OATP1B3 and NTCP (by TBBPA) and OAT3 (by
      BPA, BPF, BPS and TBBPA); by contrast, activities of other transporters
      were not impacted (MATE2-K) or were stimulated (notably OCT1 by BPS and
      OCT2 by BPF). Transporter inhibitions due to bisphenols were
      concentrations-dependent, with half maximal inhibitory concentrations
      (IC50) ranging from 0.5&mu;M to 73.5&mu;M. BPA was finally shown to be not
      transported by OAT3, although inhibiting this transporter in a competitive
      manner. Taken together, these data indicate that bisphenols interact with
      SLC transporters, at concentration levels however rather higher than those
      occurring in humans in response to environmental exposure.

ABSTRACT:
      A comprehensive analytical method based on high performance liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was developed for
      measuring 6 exogenous endocrine disruptors--bisphenol diglycidyl ethers,
      including bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), bisphenol A glycidyl
      (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether (BADGE x H2O), bisphenol A glycidyl
      (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) ether ( BADGE x HCl), bisphenol A
      (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether (BADGE x H2O x
      HCl), bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) and bisphenol F bis
      (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) ether (BFDGE x 2HCl). The samples were
      extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) by ultrasonic wave assistant
      extraction. The extracts were cleaned up and concentrated on multi-walled
      carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The target compounds were analyzed by
      HPLC-MS/MS under positive ion mode using a COSMOSIL C18 column as
      analytical column. Under the optimal conditions, the calibration curves
      showed a good linearity in the concentration range of 1.0-100.0 microg/L
      for 6 target compounds. The correlation coefficients (r2) were higher than
      0.999 1. Recoveries of 6 analytes at three spiked levels ranged from 78.6%
      to 89.9%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 10%. The
      detection limits of the method ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 microg/L. The method
      is sensitive and simple, and is suitable for the rapid determination of
      the migration of bisphenol diglycidyl ethers from food contact materials.

ABSTRACT:
      Epoxy resins can be prepared from numerous chemical compositions. Until
      recently, alternatives to epoxy resins based on diglycidyl ethers of
      bisphenol A (DGEBA) or bisphenol F (DGEBF) monomers have not received
      commercial interest, but are presently doing so, as epoxy resins with
      various properties are desired. Epoxy resin systems are known to cause
      allergic contact dermatitis because of contents of uncured monomers,
      reactive diluents, and hardeners. Reactive diluents, for example, glycidyl
      ethers, which also contain epoxide moieties, are added to reduce viscosity
      and improve polymerization. We have investigated the contact allergenic
      properties of a series of six analogues to phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE),
      all with similar basic structures but with varying carbon chain lengths
      and degrees of saturation. The chemical reactivity of the compounds in the
      test series toward the hexapeptide H-Pro-His-Cys-Lys-Arg-Met-OH was
      investigated. All epoxides were shown to bind covalently to both cysteine
      and proline residues. The percent depletion of nonreacted peptide was also
      studied resulting in 88% depletion when using PGE and 46% when using butyl
      glycidyl ether (5) at the same time point, thus revealing a large
      difference between the fastest and the slowest reacting epoxide. The skin
      sensitization potencies of the epoxides using the murine local lymph node
      assay (LLNA) were evaluated in relation to the observed physicochemical
      and reactivity properties. To enable determination of statistical
      significance between structurally closely related compounds, a nonpooled
      LLNA was performed. It was found that the compounds investigated ranged
      from strong to weak sensitizers, congruent with the reactivity data,
      indicating that even small changes in chemical structure result in
      significant differences in sensitizing capacity.

ABSTRACT:
      BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The photolysis of dichlorophen (DCP) in
      acidic medium yields 4chloro-4'-hydroxy-2,2'-methylenediphenol (I) in the
      absence of oxygen and a benzoquinone-like derivative (II) in oxygenated
      solution. At pH = 9, DCP is in monoanionic form, and three products, I, II
      and 4-chloro-2,2'-methylenediphenol (III) are detected after irradiation
      of deoxygenated solutions of DCP. Formation of III is also observed in
      acidic or neutral solutions containing a low percentage of isopropanol.
      These results can be  explained by the formation of a carbene after HCl
      elimination and reaction of this intermediate with water, oxygen, alcohol,
      anionic form of I or DCP.

ABSTRACT:
      Epoxy resin systems (ERSs) are a frequent cause of occupational allergic
      contact dermatitis. Sensitization occurs not only to the resins, but also
      to hardeners and reactive diluents. However, only a fraction of the ERS
      components currently in use are available for patch testing. With the
      multicentre study EPOX 2002, we attempted to improve diagnostics in this
      field by patch testing with components currently used in ERSs. During the
      first study period (October 2002 to July 2003), in addition to
      commercially available ERS patch test substances, 16 study substances (1
      resin, 9 hardeners and 6 reactive diluents) were patch tested in 70
      patients with suspected contact allergy due to ERSs and 22 patients with a
      prior positive patch test reaction to epoxy resin (ER) in the standard
      series. Most frequently, allergic reactions to ER based on diglycidyl
      ether of bisphenol A and F were observed (55.2% and 43.7%, respectively).
      Agreement between positive reactions to both resins, which can be
      explained by immunological cross-sensitization and/or coexposure, was
      substantial [Cohen's kappa 0.65 (95% CI: 0.49-0.80)]. Among the reactive
      diluents, 1,6-hexanediol diglycidyl ether (1,6-HDDGE) and 1,4-butanediol
      diglycidyl ether (1,4-BDDGE) were the most frequent allergens, with 19.5%
      and 18.4% positive reactions, respectively. Although agreement between
      positive reactions to 1,6-HDDGE and 1,4-BDDGE was even better than with
      the 2 resins, the sample size is considered too small to decide reliably
      whether 1,6-HDDGE alone could serve as a marker allergen for both.
      Allergic reactions to p-tert-butylphenyl glycidyl ether and to phenyl
      glycidyl ether (PGE) occurred in 11.5% of the patients tested, with only
      moderate agreement. All patients positive to cresyl glycidyl ether (6.8%)
      also reacted to PGE. Of the hardeners tested, m-xylylene diamine was the
      most frequent allergen (13.8%), followed by isophorone diamine (5.7%). No
      reactions were observed to several substances, the test concentration of
      which may have been too low and will be increased in the future.

ABSTRACT:
      In this study, the sensitizing capacities of the 3 main
      low-molecular-weight isomers of epoxy resins based on diglycidyl ether of
      biphenol F (DGEBF) were investigated in a guinea pig maximization test
      (GPMT). The isomers are p,p'-DGEBF, o,p'-DGEBF, and o,o'-DGEBF. The
      sensitization capacities were compared to diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A
      (DGEBA), which is the main constituent in the most common epoxy resin. The
      cross-reaction pattern between all 4 compounds was also investigated. It
      was found that all 3 DGEBF isomers were potent sensitizers. It was also
      found that p,p'-DGEBF, o,p'-DGEBF, and DGEBA cross-reacted with one
      another, and that animals induced with o,o'-DGEBF reacted significantly
      only to o,p'-DGEBF, but not to the other 2 DGEBF isomers or DGEBA.

ABSTRACT:
      Phthalates and phenolic substances were investigated in urine samples from
      first-time mothers in Uppsala, Sweden, collected between 2009 and 2014.
      These substances have a comparably fast metabolism and urinary metabolites
      are predominantly analysed. The main aim was to investigate if measures to
      decrease production and use of certain phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA)
      have resulted in decreased human exposure, and to determine if exposures
      to replacement chemicals have increased. Temporal trends were evaluated
      for metabolites (n=13) of seven phthalates, a phthalate replacer, four
      different bisphenols, triclosan, one organophosphate-based flame
      retardant, and for two pesticides. The results showed downward trends of
      several phthalates which are in the process of being regulated and phased
      out. Concomitantly, an increasing trend was seen for a metabolite of the
      phthalate replacer Di-iso-nonylcyclohexane 1,2-dicarboxylate (DiNCH).
      Bisphenol A (BPA) showed a downward trend, whereas bisphenol F, identified
      as one of the substitutes for BPA, showed an increasing trend. The
      decreasing trend of triclosan is likely due to declining use within the
      EU. Temporal trend studies of urine samples make it possible to
      investigate human exposure to rapidly metabolised substances and study how
      measures taken to regulate and replace problematic chemicals affect human
      exposure.

ABSTRACT:
      Monitoring of food contamination from bisphenols is a necessary process
      for the consumers' risk assessment. A method for the quali-quantitative
      analysis of Bisphenol A (BPA), Bisphenol B (BPB), Bisphenol A Diglycidyl
      Ether (BADGE), and Bisphenol F Diglycidyl Ether (BFDGE), by liquid
      chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FD), was performed and
      validated for their determination in 33 samples of tuna fish, canned in
      either oil or aqueous medium. Samples were collected in Italian markets.
      Tuna and the correspondent preservation medium were analyzed separately.
      Detected levels of bisphenols ranged from 19.1 to 187.0 ng/g in tuna
      matrix and from 6.3 to 66.9 ng/mL in oil medium. No bisphenols were found
      in aqueous medium. At least one of the analytes was found in 83% of the
      tuna samples in oil medium, whereas tuna samples in aqueous medium showed
      BPA alone in 67% of samples. 21% of the oil medium samples resulted
      positive for at least one bisphenol. On the basis of measured
      concentrations and general daily ingestion rate of canned tuna fish, the
      probable daily intake of BPA for Italian population was calculated.

ABSTRACT:
      Herein, we report a carbazolyl tubular macrocycle (3), which possesses a
      "&pi;-tube" capable of encapsulating and sensing bisphenol F (BPF), which
      is a toxic industrial material. In this work, the synthesis of 3, its
      conformation in solution as well as its binding property to BPF have been
      investigated. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), ultraviolet-visible light
      (UV-vis), fluorescence spectra, and molecular modeling studies reveal that
      the "&pi;-tube" of 3 in 1,3-alternate conformation could encapsulate BPF
      with 1:1 binding stoichiometry in water, with its orthogonal tweezers
      sandwiching the two phenol units of BPF. Moreover, 3 could serve as a
      sensitive fluorescent probe for BPF (limitation of detection = 157 nM).

ABSTRACT:
      The levels of bisphenol-F-diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) were quantified as part
      of a European survey on the migration of residues of epoxy resins into oil
      from canned fish. The contents of BFDGE in cans, lids and fish collected
      from all 15 Member States of the European Union and Switzerland were
      analysed in 382 samples. Cans and lids were separately extracted with
      acetonitrile. The extraction from fish was carried out with hexane
      followed by re-extraction with acetonitrile. The analysis was performed by
      reverse phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. BFDGE could be detected in
      12% of the fish, 24% of the cans and 18% of the lids. Only 3% of the fish
      contained BFDGE in concentrations considerably above 1 mg/kg. In addition
      to the presented data, a comparison was made with the levels of BADGE
      (bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether) analysed in the same products in the
      context of a previous study.

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND: The plastic monomer and plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA), used
      for manufacturing polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins, is produced at
      over 2.5 million metric tons per year. Concerns have been raised that BPA
      acts as an endocrine disruptor on both developmental and reproductive
      processes and a large body of evidence suggests that BPA interferes with
      estrogen and thyroid hormone signaling. Here, we investigated BPA effects
      during embryonic development using the zebrafish and Xenopus models.

      RESULTS: We report that BPA exposure leads to severe malformations of the
      otic vesicle. In zebrafish and in Xenopus embryos, exposure to BPA during
      the first developmental day resulted in dose-dependent defects in otolith
      formation. Defects included aggregation, multiplication and occasionally
      failure to form otoliths. As no effects on otolith development were seen
      with exposure to micromolar concentrations of thyroid hormone,
      17-&szlig;-estradiol or of the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 we
      conclude that the effects of BPA are independent of estrogen receptors or
      thyroid-hormone receptors. Na+/K+ ATPases are crucial for otolith
      formation in zebrafish. Pharmacological inhibition of the major Na+/K+
      ATPase with ouabain can rescue the BPA-induced otolith phenotype.

      CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the spectrum of BPA action is wider
      than previously expected and argue for a systematic survey of the
      developmental effects of this endocrine disruptor.

ABSTRACT:
      BADGE.2HCl and BFDGE.2HCl were determined in 28 samples of ready-to-drink
      canned coffee and 18 samples of canned vegetables (10 corn, 5 tomatoes and
      3 others), all from the Japanese market. HPLC was used as the principal
      analytical method and GC-MS for confirmation of relevant LC fractions.
      BADGE.2HCl was found to be present in one canned coffee and five samples
      of corn, BFDGE.2HCl in four samples of canned tomatoes and in one canned
      corn. No sample was found which exceeded the 1 mg/kg limit of the EU for
      the BADGE chlorohydrins. However the highest concentration was found for
      the sum of BFDGE.2HCl anti BFDGE.HCl.H2O at a level of 1.5 mg/kg. A
      Beilstein test confirmed that all cans containing foods contaminated with
      BADGE.2HCl or BFDGE.2HCl had at lest one part coated with a PVC organosol.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) has been found in plastic food containers, paper
      currencies and toys. BPA has been reported for various adverse health
      concerns including reproduction, development and carcinogenesis. These
      potential health implications have led to increasing use of alternative
      bisphenols such as bisphenol F and bisphenol S among many. However, little
      is known about the toxicity of alternative bisphenols and most of the
      toxicological information is limited to endocrine disrupting potentials.
      In this study, we evaluated cytotoxicity and the genotoxic potentials of
      several bisphenol compounds, and identified the mechanism of genotoxicity
      using a panel of mutant chicken DT40 cell lines deficient in DNA repair
      pathways. Several bisphenols including bisphenol AP, bisphenol M, or
      bisphenol P exerted genotoxic potentials that are greater than that of
      BPA. Generally RAD54(-/-) mutant cells were the most sensitive to all
      bisphenols except for bisphenol F, suggesting the induction of DNA
      double-strand breaks that could be rescued by homologous recombination.
      Genotoxic potential of bisphenols was confirmed by chromosomal aberration
      assay and &gamma;-H2AX foci forming assay between wild-type and RAD54(-/-)
      mutant. Among the tested bisphenols, BPP at 12.5&mu;M showed the greatest
      genotoxic potency, inducing chromosomal aberration and &gamma;-H2AX foci
      in RAD54(-/-) mutant by 2.6 and 4.8 folds greater than those in wild-type,
      respectively. Our results clearly show several alternative bisphenols can
      cause genotoxicity that could be rescued by homologous recombination
      pathway, and some bisphenols induced even greater genotoxic potentials
      than that of BPA.

ABSTRACT:
      A high performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous
      analysis of phenolic compounds, such as, phenol, m-cresol, bisphenol A,
      bisphenol F, 4-tert-butylphenol, bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) and
      bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) in mineral water with fluorometric
      detector is described in this paper. After pretreatment through
      solid-liquid extraction, the sample was analyzed by HPLC. The operating
      conditions were Turner C18, 5 microns, column, 150 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.,
      mobile phase with V(ACN): V(water) = 40:60 for 10 min, then linear
      gradient elution for 25 min up to 80:20 with a flow rate of 1.3 mL/min.
      Excitation wavelength was set at 275 nm and emmission at 300 nm. The
      recoveries were 81%-105% and the RSDs were 1.12%-13.21%. Detection limit
      reached 0.1-0.2 microgram/L.

ABSTRACT:
      BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  We studied the first-order degradation
      kinetics of Bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) in three water-based food
      simulants (3% (w/v) acetic acid, distilled water, and 15% (v/v) ethanol)
      at various temperatures. BFDGE and its first and second hydrolysis
      products were determined by reversed phase high-performance liquid
      chromatography with flourescence detection. Nonlinear regression was used
      to fit the experimental data at 40, 50, and 60ÍC with the proposed
      kinetics equations; the Arrhenius equation was then fitted to the rate
      constants obtained, and the kinetic models were tested by comparing
      experimental data obtained at 70ÍC with the kinetic curves calculated
      using the rate constants predicted for this temperature. The half-life of
      BFDGE was longest in ethanol and shortest in acetic acid. The difference
      between the hydrolysis rates of BFDGE and Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether may
      be due to 10% of the BFDGE used being in n = 1 monomer form. The results
      imply that resins w

ABSTRACT:
      The accelerated removal of bisphenols A and F (BPA, BPF) was observed in
      the rhizosphere sediment of Phragmites australis, while they persisted in
      the absence of P. australis. A BPA-degrading bacterium, Novosphingobium
      sp. strain TYA-1, and a BPF-degrading bacterium, Sphingobium yanoikuyae
      strain TYF-1, were isolated from the rhizosphere of P. australis. The
      results suggested that interactions between P. australis and these
      bacteria can accelerate the removal of bisphenols from sediment.

ABSTRACT:
      BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Epoxy novolacs (NOGE) seem to find
      increasing use in coatings for cans, partly to replace
      Bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether (BADGE). Bisphenol-F-diglycidyl ether
      (BADGE), the 2-ring NOGE, was analyzed by LC and LC-LC with fluorescence
      detection (FD) or GC-MS. 3- and 4-ring NOGEs were identified by LC-MS and
      determined in foods by LC-FD. NOGE was less frequently found in canned
      foods than BADGE and was almost always accompanied by BADGE. In 9% of 227
      samples, BADGE concentrations exceeded 20 mug/kg,  in 6% also the 100
      mug/kg above which products were confiscated. 3- and 4-ring NOGE
      frequently reached concentrations exceeding that of BADGE by a factor of
      5. When also including the chlorohydroxy-NOGE and the oligomers into
      consideration, the number of components co be analyzed becomes exceedingly
      high.

      sludge, dump water, liquid manure) in order to contribute to a better
      understanding of exposure to these compounds in different environments.
      Hundred and sixteen surface-water samples and 35 sediments from rivers,
      lakes and channels, 39 sewage effluents, and 38 sewage sludges were
      collected in Germany. Furthermore, ten liquid manure, two waste-dump and
      two compost-runoff water samples were also analysed. BPA measurements
      showed low concentrations from 0.0005 to 0.41 microg L(-1) in surface
      water, in sewage effluents from 0.018 to 0.702 microg L(-1), in sediments
      from 0.01 to 0.19 mgkg(-1) and in sewage sludge from 0.004 to
      1.363mgkg(-1) dw. Measured concentrations of BPF were clearly lower than
      BPA in all environmental media. DEHP dominated the phthalate
      concentrations, which ranged from 0.33 to 97.8 microg L(-1) (surface
      water), 1.74 to 182 microg L(-1) (sewage effluents), 27.9 to 154 mgkg(-1)
      dw (sewage sludge) and 0.21 to 8.44 mgkg(-1) (sediment). DBP was found
      only in minor concentrations and BBP, only in a few samples in low
      amounts. Very high concentrations of BPA and phthalates were confirmed in
      waste dump water and compost water samples as well as in the liquid manure
      samples.

ABSTRACT:
      The use of Bisphenol A (BPA) has been regulated in many countries because
      of its potential adverse effects on human health. As a result of the
      restriction, structural anologues such as bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol
      F (BPF) have already been used for industrial applications as alternatives
      to BPA. Bisphenol AF (BPAF) is mainly used as a crosslinker in the
      synthesis of specialty fluoroelastomers. These compounds have been
      detected in various environmental matrices and human samples. Previous
      studies have shown that these compounds have potential endocrine
      disrupting effects on wildlife and mammals in general. However, the
      effects on adrenocortical function and the underlying mechanisms are not
      fully understood. In the present study, the H295R cell line was used as a
      model to compare the cell toxicity and to investigate the potential
      endocrine disrupting action of four BPs (including BPA, BPS, BPF, and
      BPAF). The half lethal concentration (LC50) values at 72 h exposure
      indicated that the rank order of toxicities of the chemicals was BPAF   > 
      BPA   >  BPS   >  BPF. The hormone results demonstrated that BPA
      analogues, such as BPF, BPS and BPAF were capable of altering
      steroidogenesis in H295R cells. BPA and BPS exhibited inhibition of
      hormone production, BPF predominantly led to increased progesterone and
      17&beta;-estradiol levels and BPAF showed induction of progesterone and
      reduction of testosterone. Inhibition effects of BPA and BPAF on hormone
      production were probably mediated by down-regulation of steroidogenic
      genes in H295R cells. However, the mechanisms of the endocrine
      interrupting action of BPF and BPS are still unclear, which may have
      additional mechanisms that have not been detected with BPA.

      Focused ulused ultrasonic solid-liquid extraction (FUSLE) and reverse-phase ultra
      performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a quadrupole-time of
      flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF-MS) was applied to the determination of
      bisphenol-type endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in food-contact
      recycled-paper materials. Recycled paper is a potential source of EDCs.
      Bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF) and their derivatives bisphenol A
      diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) are used
      for the production of epoxy resins employed in the formulation of printing
      inks. The FUSLE of bisphenol-type EDCs from packaging is reported for the
      first time. First, different extraction solvents were studied and methanol
      was selected. Then, the main FUSLE factors affecting the extraction
      efficiency (solvent volume, extraction time and ultrasonic irradiation
      power) were studied by means of a central composite design. The FUSLE
      conditions selected for further experiments were 20 ml of methanol at
      ultrasonic amplitude of 100% for 5s. Finally, the number of extraction
      cycles necessary for complete extraction was established in two. The
      analysis of the FUSLE extracts was carried out by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS with
      electrospray ionization and the determination of the four analytes took
      place in only 4 min. The FUSLE and UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS method was validated
      and applied to the analysis of different food-contact recycled-paper-based
      materials and packaging. The proposed method provided recoveries from 72%
      to 97%, repeatability and intermediate precision under 9% and 14%,
      respectively, and detection limits of 0.33, 0.16, 0.65 and 0.40 &mu;g/g
      for BPA, BPF, BADGE and BFDGE, respectively. The analysis of paper and
      cardboard samples confirmed the presence of EDCs in these packaging.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) is an industrial chemical produced in large volumes. Its
      main use is associated with polycarbonate plastic, epoxy resins and
      thermal paper. In contrast to other applications, thermal paper contains
      BPA in its un-reacted form as an additive, which is subjected to
      migration. Receiving a significant amount of attention from the scientific
      community and beyond, due to its controversial endocrine-disrupting
      effects, the industry is attempting to substitute BPA in variety of
      applications. Alternative phenolic compounds have been proposed for use in
      thermal paper; however, information to what extent BPA alternatives have
      been used in paper is sparse. The aim of the present work was to quantify
      BPA and its alternatives (bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol E (BPE), bisphenol
      B (BPB), 4-cumylphenol (HPP) and bisphenol F (BPF)) in waste paper and
      board from Danish households, thermal paper receipts, non-carbon copy
      paper and conventional printer paper. BPA was found in all waste paper
      samples analysed, while BPS was identified in 73% of them. Only BPB was
      not identified in any of the samples. BPA and BPS were found in the
      majority of the receipts, which contained no measurable concentrations of
      the remaining alternatives. Although receipts showed the highest
      concentrations of BPA and BPS, office paper, flyers and corrugated boxes,
      together with receipts, represented the major flux of the two compounds in
      waste paper streams.

ABSTRACT:
      In this study, a paper spray ionization mass spectrometric (PS-MS) method
      was developed for the rapid in situ screening and simultaneous
      quantitative analysis of bisphenol A and its analogues, i.e., bisphenol S,
      bisphenol F, and bisphenol AF, in food packaging products. At the optimal
      PS-MS conditions, the calibration curves of bisphenols in the range of
      1-100 &mu;g/mL were linear. The correlation coefficients were higher than
      0.998, and the LODs of the target compounds were 0.1-0.3 &mu;g/mL. After a
      simple treatment by dichloromethane on the surface, the samples were
      analyzed by PS-MS in situ for rapid screening without a traditional sample
      pretreatment procedure, such as powdering, extraction, and enrichment
      steps. The analytical time of the PS-MS method was less than 1 min. In
      comparison with conventional HPLC-MS/MS, it was demonstrated that PS-MS
      was a more effective high-throughput screening and quantitative analysis
      method.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) and its analogs are widely used in the production of
      various everyday use products, which leads to a common exposure of humans
      to these substances. The effect of bisphenols on oxidative stress
      parameters has not been described in detail in non-nucleated cells,
      therefore, we have decided to evaluate the impact of BPA and its analogs,
      i.e. bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol AF (BPAF) on
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation, glutathione
      (GSH) level and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase
      (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in human erythrocytes. The
      erythrocytes were incubated with the compounds studied in the
      concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 500&mu;g/ml for 1, 4 or 24h. It has
      been found that bisphenols enhanced ROS (including &bull;OH) formation,
      depleted GSH level, increased lipid peroxidation and changed the
      activities of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px. It has been noted that the strongest
      alterations in ROS formation, lipid peroxidation and the activity of
      antioxidant enzymes were induced by BPAF, which changed CAT and SOD
      activity even at 0.5&mu;g/ml. It has also been shown that BPA caused the
      strongest changes in GSH level, while BPS, which is the main BPA
      substituent in the manufacture did not alter most parameters studied.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been suspected to be associated with
      deleterious effects on health including obesity and metabolically-linked
      diseases. Although bisphenols F (BPF) and S (BPS) are BPA structural
      analogs commonly used in many marketed products as a replacement for BPA,
      only sparse toxicological data are available yet. Our objective was to
      comprehensively characterize bisphenols gene targets in a human primary
      adipocyte model, in order to determine whether they may induce cellular
      dysfunction, using chronic exposure at two concentrations: a "low-dose"
      similar to the dose usually encountered in human biological fluids and a
      higher dose. Therefore, BPA, BPF and BPS have been added at 10 nM or 10
      &mu;M during the differentiation of human primary adipocytes from
      subcutaneous fat of three non-diabetic Caucasian female patients. Gene
      expression (mRNA/lncRNA) arrays and microRNA arrays, have been used to
      assess coding and non-coding RNA changes. We detected significantly
      deregulated mRNA/lncRNA and miRNA at low and high doses. Enrichment in
      "cancer" and "organismal injury and abnormalities" related pathways was
      found in response to the three products. Some long intergenic non-coding
      RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs were differentially expressed suggesting
      that bisphenols may also activate multiple cellular processes and
      epigenetic modifications. The analysis of upstream regulators of
      deregulated genes highlighted hormones or hormone-like chemicals
      suggesting that BPS and BPF can be suspected to interfere, just like BPA,
      with hormonal regulation and have to be considered as endocrine
      disruptors. All these results suggest that as BPA, its substitutes BPS and
      BPF should be used with the same restrictions.

ABSTRACT:
      A new and simple liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry method for
      the determination of different bisphenol A (BPA) derivatives such as
      bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE)
      and their reaction products with water and hydrochloric acid in different
      fish food products was developed. The extraction procedure and the
      chromatographic conditions were optimised for complex food matrices such
      as fish products. Food samples were homogenised and extracted with a 1:1
      solution of acetonitrile-hexane, the solvent was eliminated in a N(2)
      stream and the extract was reconstituted with 0.5mL of a 0.01M solution of
      ammonium formate. The sample solution obtained was directly measured by
      LC-MS/MS without any further purification under the developed conditions.
      The use of a mobile phase composed by ammonium formate-methanol in a
      binary gradient mode produced [M+NH(4)](+) aducts for the different BADGEs
      and BFDGEs. These aduct's fragmentations were employed for the LC-MS/MS
      quantification of BPA derivatives in canned fish samples. The results of
      the validation were appropriate: the method was linear for BADGE and its
      hydrolysed derivatives up to 1000&mu;gkg(-1), for the remaining compounds
      linearity achieved up to 100&mu;gkg(-1). Quantification limits were in the
      range 2-10&mu;gkg(-1). RSD (intra and inter-day) was 6-12% and the
      recovery was comprised between 89% and 109%. Under the optimised
      conditions, the chromatographic separation was performed in 8min per
      sample. The method was applied to the determination of BADGE, BFDGE and
      their reaction products in different samples of canned fish from Spanish
      origin. Migration results obtained were in compliance with the EU
      regulations.

ABSTRACT:
      A straightforward method was established for the determination of
      migration contaminants in olive oil with a special focus on the two
      can-coating migration compounds bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and
      bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE). The preferred sample preparation was
      a single liquid-liquid extraction of compounds from the oil into 20% (v/v)
      methanol in acetonitrile, followed by clean-up with solid-phase extraction
      on aminopropyl bonded to silica. This purification procedure selectively
      removed all free fatty acids from the extracts without removing phenolic
      compounds of interest. The solid-phase extraction columns were used many
      times by implementing a procedure of washing out the strongly retained
      fatty acids with 2% acetic acid in methanol. Gas chromatography coupled
      with full scan (m/z 33-700) electron ionization mass spectrometry was used
      for the determination of several model compounds in olive oil samples.
      BADGE and BFDGE could be determined in the 0.05-2 mg kg(-1) range in oil
      samples with a relative SD of   < 6% (six replicates). The method was used
      in an enforcement campaign for the Norwegian Food Control Authority to
      analyse vegetable oil samples from canned fish-in-oil.

ABSTRACT:
      Epoxy resin systems (ERSs) are a frequent cause of occupational allergic
      contact dermatitis. A 50-year-old patient developed eczematous skin
      lesions on the back of his hands, lower arms and eye lids, 2 months after
      he had started working in aircraft construction. Patch tests showed
      positive reactions at day 3 to nickel sulfate, epoxy resin based on
      diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F (DGEBF) and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl
      ether (1,4-BDDGE). The chemical triglycidyl-p-aminophenol (TGPAP) applied
      at 1% and 0.1% induced the strongest (+++ positive) reaction. About 4
      months after the patch test with TGPAP, the patient presented with 2
      circular depigmented spots in the former TGPAP-patch test areas.
      Dermatohistopathology confirmed the diagnosis of contact vitiligo.

ABSTRACT:
      Epoxy resin monomers (ERMs), especially diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A
      and F (DGEBA and DGEBF), are extensively used as building blocks for
      thermosetting polymers. However, they are known to commonly cause skin
      allergy. This research describes a number of alternative ERMs, designed
      with the aim of reducing the skin sensitizing potency while maintaining
      the ability to form thermosetting polymers. The compounds were designed,
      synthesized, and assessed for sensitizing potency using the in vivo murine
      local lymph node assay (LLNA). All six epoxy resin monomers had decreased
      sensitizing potencies compared to those of DGEBA and DGEBF. With respect
      to the LLNA EC3 value, the best of the alternative monomers had a value
      approximately 2.5 times higher than those of DGEBA and DGEBF. The
      diepoxides were reacted with triethylenetetramine, and the polymers formed
      were tested for technical applicability using thermogravimetric analysis
      and differential scanning calorimetry. Four out of the six alternative
      ERMs gave polymers with a thermal stability comparable to that obtained
      with DGEBA and DGEBF. The use of improved epoxy resin monomers with less
      skin sensitizing effects is a direct way to tackle the problem of contact
      allergy to epoxy resin systems, particularly in occupational settings,
      resulting in a reduction in the incidence of allergic contact dermatitis.

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND: Epoxy products are among the most common causes of
      occupational allergic contact dermatitis. Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A
      resin (DGEBA-R) is the most important sensitizer in epoxy systems.

      OBJECTIVES: To describe patients with occupational allergic contact
      dermatitis caused by epoxy products.

      METHODS: Patients with allergic reactions to epoxy chemicals were chosen
      from test files (January 1991 to June 2014). Only patients with
      occupational contact allergy to some component of epoxy resin systems were
      included. We analysed patch test results, occupation, symptoms, and
      exposure data.

      RESULTS: We found a total of 209 cases with occupational contact allergy
      to epoxy chemicals. The largest occupational groups were painters (n =
      41), floor layers (n = 19), electrical industry workers (n = 19), tile
      setters (n = 16), and aircraft industry workers (n = 15). A total of 82%
      of the patients reacted to DGEBA-R. Diagnosis of the DGEBA-R-negative
      patients required testing with m-xylylenediamine,
      N,N'-tetraglycidyl-4,4'-methylenedianiline, 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl
      ether, 2,4,6-tris-(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol, diglycidyl ether of
      bisphenol F resin, N,N'-diglycidyl-4-glycidyloxyaniline,
      isophoronediamine, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane, diethylenetriamine, and
      cresyl glycidyl ether. The hands/upper extremities were most commonly
      affected (69%), but facial symptoms were also frequent (60%).

      CONCLUSIONS: Allergic contact dermatitis caused by to epoxy products
      cannot always be diagnosed by the use of commercial test substances.
      Workplace products need to be tested.

ABSTRACT:
      A simple and fast method for both dummy template selection and polymer
      composition optimization is proposed here. A series of dummy templates for
      bisphenols imprinting were screened by running them on a non-imprinted
      polymer (NIP) column with porogen solvent as mobile phase. The tested
      dummy templates mainly involved bisphenol S (BPS), bromobisphenol A
      (TBBPA), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol E (BPE), bisphenol B (BPB),
      bisphenol AF (BPAF), 2,2',6,6'-tetramethyl-4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol (BS-TM)
      and 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane (DADPM). Different monomers and porogens
      were also investigated for BPS and DADPM using the same method. BPS dummy
      template was finally selected with acetonitrile and 4-VP as porogen and
      monomer. The resulting dummy molecularly imprinted polymer (DMIP) achieved
      superior affinities for BPF, BPE, BPA, BPB and BPAF with imprinting
      factors 14.5, 13.8, 8.7, 5.7 and 4.2, respectively. An efficient method
      based on BPS-DMIP-SPE coupled with HPLC-UV was developed for selective
      extraction of BPF, BPE, BPA, BPB and BPAF in water samples. The method
      showed excellent recoveries (89.4-102.0%) and precision (RSD 0.3-4.8%,
      n=5) for tap and river water samples spiked at three concentration levels
      each (40, 200 and 1000ngL(-1)). The detection limits ranged between 2.2
      and 3.8ngL(-1) with a sample volume of 500mL. The result demonstrated the
      superiority of the optimized method for selective extraction of BPs in
      water samples at the ngL(-1) level.

ABSTRACT:
      The objective of this study was to compare the estrogenicity of
      xenoestrogens found in food wrap packaging and phytoestrogen flavonoids.
      Uterotrophic and vaginal cornification assays were performed on immature
      and ovariectomized rats. Genistein, bisphenol F, and octylphenol were
      identified as estrogenic only in immature rats. Using vaginal
      cornification as a more specific estrogenic parameter, all tested
      compounds except tangeretin were active in immature rats. While apigenin
      and kaempferol appeared to have low estrogenic activity, they
      potentialized the uterotrophic effect of 17beta-estradiol in immature
      rats. These data showed that (i) phytoestrogens like genistein can be as
      potent or even more estrogenic than compounds found in food wrap
      packaging, (ii) immature rats appear to be a more sensitive in vivo model
      than ovariectomized rats in term of estrogenicity, (iii) the vaginal
      cornification assay could be a sensitive and useful test to detect weak
      estrogenic compounds to which humans can be exposed via food.

ABSTRACT:
      In this study, the combined use of a biopolymer chitosan and an
      oxidoreductase polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was systematically investigated
      for the removal of bisphenol derivatives from aqueous medium. The process
      parameters, such as the pH value, temperature, and PPO concentration, were
      estimated to conduct the enzymatic quinone oxidation of bisphenol
      derivatives by as little enzyme as possible. Bisphenol derivatives
      effectively underwent PPO-catalysed quinone oxidation without H2O2 unlike
      other oxidoreductases, such as peroxidase and tyrosinase, and the optimum
      conditions were determined to be pH 7.0 and 40&deg;C for bisphenol B,
      bisphenol E, bisphenol O, and bisphenol Z; pH 7.0 and 30&deg;C for
      bisphenol C and bisphenol F; and pH 8.0 and 40&deg;C for bisphenol T. They
      were completely removed through adsorption of enzymatically generated
      quinone derivatives on chitosan beads or chitosan powders. Quinone
      adsorption on chitosan beads or chitosan powders in the heterogeneous
      system was found to be a more effective procedure than generation of
      aggregates in the homogeneous system with chitosan solution. The removal
      time was shortened by increasing the amount of chitosan beads or
      decreasing the size of the chitosan powders.

ABSTRACT:
      4-Alkylphenols, 4-alkylphenol ethoxylates, 4-alkylphenoxy carboxylates,
      bisphenol A, bisphenol F, 4-hydroxyacetophenon, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and
      steroid hormones were analyzed in water samples of the River Elbe and its
      tributaries Schwarze Elster, Mulde, Saale, Havel and Schwinge.
      Additionally, freshly deposited sediments (FDS, composite samples) of the
      River Elbe and its tributaries were analyzed. The concentrations in water
      samples ranged from (in ng/l): bisphenol A 4 to 92, branched nonylphenol
      13 to 87, branched nonylphenol ethoxylates   < 0.5 to 120, 4-tert.
      nonylphenoxy carboxylates   < 10 to 940 and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid 4 to 12.
      Steroid hormones were only detected in the Czech tributaries Jizera and
      Vltava in concentrations near the limit of quantification. In FDS samples
      the concentrations amounted to (in g/kg d.w.): bisphenol A 10-380,
      branched nonylphenol 27-430, branched nonylphenol ethoxylates 24-3700,
      nonylphenoxy carboxylates   < 50 and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid 23-4400.
      Increased bisphenol A concentrations were found in water and FDS samples
      taken from the Czech-German border at Schmilka and the mouth of the
      Schwinge (only water sample). According to studies conducted in the Elbe
      Estuary and the German Bight, the River Elbe must be considered as a major
      source of pollution for the North Sea in respect of the compounds
      analyzed. A comparison of bisphenol A concentrations, 4-alkylphenols and
      the corresponding ethoxylates analyzed in the River Elbe and its
      tributaries with those found in other German surface waters indicated a
      low level of contamination. The evaluation of the data based on
      LOEC-values indicated that the concentrations were well below the
      effectivity threshold for some 4-alkylphenols. According to recent
      ecotoxicological investigations, for example, with prosobranch snails,
      bisphenol A concentrations found in water samples of the River Elbe and
      its tributaries may well be detrimental to aquatic organisms. On the basis
      of the monitoring data and its implications for estrogenic potency the
      inclusion of bisphenol A in the list of priority substances (European
      Union Directive 2000/60/EC, Annex X) should be considered.

ABSTRACT:
      Exposure of humans to environmental phenolic compounds such as bisphenol A
      (BPA) and alkylphenols is a matter of concern, due to these compounds'
      ubiquitous occurrence and estrogenic potencies. Little is known about the
      levels of environmental phenolics in personal care products (PCPs). In
      this study, nonylphenol, two octylphenols, eight bisphenols (BPA and its
      analogs), and triclosan (TCS) were determined by liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in PCP samples
      (n      =      231) collected from China and the United States (U.S.). The
      concentrations of 4-n-nonylphenol (4-NP), 4-n-octylphenol (4-OP),
      4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), and TCS were in the ranges of   < 0.5-39,100
      [geometric mean (GM): 21.5],   < 0.5-315 (0.680),   < 1.0-10,100 (2.69),
      and   < 0.5-53,900 (3.03)      ng/g, respectively. The GM concentrations
      of individual bisphenols, including BPA, bisphenol S (BPS), and bisphenol
      F (BPF), were generally at sub-nanogram per gram levels. No significant
      differences in concentrations of the target compounds were found among
      various PCP categories or between China and the U.S. The estimated GM
      daily intakes of 4-NP, &sum;OPs (sum of 4-OP and 4-t-OP), &sum;BPs (sum of
      eight bisphenols), and TCS through dermal absorption from the use of PCPs
      were 0.932, 0.093, 0.072, and 0.016      &mu;g/day, respectively, for
      adult Chinese women and 0.340, 0.054, 0.120, and 0.068      &mu;g/day,
      respectively, for adult U.S. women. Body lotions, face creams, and liquid
      foundations accounted for the majority (  > 85      %) of the dermal
      exposure doses of the target phenolics.

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The toxic chemicals bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F
      (BPF), nonylphenol (NP), and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) are
      endocrine-disrupting chemicals that have consequently drawn much concern
      regarding their effect on the environment. The objectives of this study
      were to investigate the degradation of BPA, BPF, NP, and TBBPA by enzymes
      from Pleurotus eryngii in submerged fermentation (SmF) and solid-state
      fermentation (SSF), and also to assess the removal of toxic chemicals in
      spent mushroom compost (SMC).

      METHODS: BPA and BPF were analyzed by high-performance liquid
      chromatography; NP and TBBPA were analyzed by gas chromatography.

      RESULTS: NP degradation was enhanced by adding CuSO4 (1 mM), MnSO4 (0.5
      mM), gallic acid (1 mM), tartaric acid (20 mM), citric acid (20 mM),
      guaiacol (1 mM), or 2,2'-azino-bis- (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
      acid; 1 mM), with the last yielding a higher NP degradation rate than the
      other additives from SmF. The optimal conditions for enzyme activity from
      SSF were a sawdust/wheat bran ratio of 1:4 and a moisture content of 5
      mL/g. The enzyme activities were higher with sawdust/wheat bran than with
      sawdust/rice bran. The optimal conditions for the extraction of enzyme
      from SMC required using sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0, solid/solution
      ratio 1:5), and extraction over 3 hours.

      CONCLUSION: The removal rates of toxic chemicals by P. eryngii, in
      descending order of magnitude, were SSF   >  SmF   >  SMC. The removal
      rates were BPF   >  BPA   >  NP   >  TBBPA.

ABSTRACT:
      This study investigated the aerobic degradation ofbisphenol-A (BPA) and
      the derivatives bisphenol-B (BPB), bisphenol-F (BPF),
      tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA), and tetrachlorobisphenol-A (TCBPA) in river
      sediment. The degradation rates of BPA and BPF were enhanced by adding
      brij 30, brij 35, rhamnolipid, surfactin, or crude enzyme; a higher
      degradation rate was observed with crude enzyme than with the other
      additives. The degradation rates of BPA and its derivatives (BPAs) in the
      sediment were BPF   >  BPA   >  BPB   >  TCBPA   >  TBBPA. Different BPAs
      affected the changes in the microbial community in the sediment. Sediment
      fractions with larger particle sizes demonstrated higher degradation
      rates. Different sediment particle sizes affected the changes in the
      microbial communities. Pseudomonas sp. may be the dominant bacteria in the
      process of degradation of BPAs in river sediment.

ABSTRACT:
      OBJECTIVE: The study's objective was 2-fold: first, to evaluate the
      potential cross-reactivity between Bis-A epoxy resins and epoxy acrylates
      and second, to study the cross reactivity between Bis-A epoxy resins and
      newer Bis-F epoxy resins in patients with allergic contact dermatitis to
      epoxy resins and had positive patch test to the standard epoxy resin based
      on bisphenol A.

      METHODS: Forty-one patients were patch tested to 23 chemicals including
      epoxy acrylates, Bis-A epoxy resins, and Bis-F epoxy resins, as well as
      reactive diluents and nonbisphenol epoxy resins. Questions concerning
      exposure to epoxy resins, occupational history, and problems with dental
      work were completed.

      RESULTS: All patients included in the study had positive reactions to the
      standard Bis-A epoxy resin. Twenty percent (8 of 41) of the patients
      reacted to at least one of the epoxy acrylates; the most common reaction
      was to Bis-GMA. Five of 8 patients who reacted to the epoxy acrylates had
      dental work, but only one patient had problems from her dental work. Six
      of 8 patients (75%) who reacted to epoxy resins and epoxy acrylates did
      not react to aliphatic acrylates. Thirty-two percent (13 of 41) reacted to
      tosylamide epoxy resin, and none reacted to triglycidyl isocyanurate
      resin. In addition, all patients (100%) had positive reactions to at least
      one of the Bis-F epoxy resins that were tested.

      CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with sensitivity to Bis-A epoxy resins do not
      cross-react with epoxy acrylates. Patients with positive patch test
      reactions to epoxy acrylates used in dentistry usually do not have
      symptoms from their dental work. To our knowledge, this is the largest
      series of patients with sensitivity to the standard Bis-A epoxy resin that
      have been patch tested with the more recently introduced Bis-F epoxy
      resins. There is significant cross-reactivity between Bis-A and Bis-F
      epoxy resins, which can be explained by their structural similarity.

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical with widespread human exposure
      suspected of causing low-dose effects. Thus, a need for developing
      alternatives to BPA exists. Structural analogues of BPA have already been
      detected in foods and humans. Due to the structural analogy of the
      alternatives, there is a risk of effects similar to BPA.

      OBJECTIVES: The aim was to elucidate and compare the hazards of bisphenol
      B (BPB), bisphenol E (BPE), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS) and
      4-cumylphenol (HPP) to BPA.

      METHODS: In vitro studies on steroidogenesis, receptor activity, and
      biomarkers of effect, as well as Quantitative Structure-Activity
      Relationship (QSAR) modeling.

      RESULTS: All test compounds caused the same qualitative effects on
      estrogen receptor and androgen receptor activities, and most of the
      alternatives exhibited potencies within the same range as BPA. Hormone
      profiles for the compounds indicated a specific mechanism of action on
      steroidogenesis which generally lead to decreased androgen, and increased
      estrogen and progestagen levels. Differential effects on corticosteroid
      synthesis were observed suggesting a compound-specific mechanism. Overall,
      BPS was less estrogenic and antiandrogenic than BPA, but BPS showed the
      largest efficacy on 17&alpha;-hydroxyprogesterone (17&alpha;-OH
      progesterone). Finally, there were indications of DNA damage,
      carcinogenicity, oxidative stress, effects on metabolism, and skin
      sensitization of one or more of the test compounds.

      CONCLUSIONS: Interference with the endocrine system was the predominant
      effect of the test compounds. A substitution of BPA with these structural
      analogues should be carried out with caution.

ABSTRACT:
      In this study, a novel method combining dispersive liquid-liquid
      microextraction (DLLME) and fast liquid chromatography coupled to mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed and validated for the extraction and
      determination of bisphenol A (BPA) and six bisphenol analogues, namely
      bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol P (BPP), bisphenol Z
      (BPZ), bisphenol AP (BPAP) and bisphenol AF (BPAF) in human urine samples.
      Type and volume of extraction and disperser solvents, pH sample, ionic
      strength, and agitation were evaluated. The matrix-matched calibration
      curves of all analytes were linear with correlation coefficients higher
      than 0.99 in the range level of 0.5-20.0ngmL(-1). The relative standard
      deviation (RSD), precision, at three concentrations (1.0, 8.0 and
      15.0ngmL(-1)) was lower than 15% with accuracy ranging from 90 to 112%.
      The biomonitoring capability of the new method was confirmed with the
      analysis of 50 human urine samples randomly collected from Brazilians. BPA
      was detected in 92% of the analyzed samples at concentrations ranging
        < LOQ to 10.4ngmL(-1). The detection rates of BPS (10%), BPAF (4%) and
      BPF (2%) were much lower than 92%.

ABSTRACT:
      An analytical procedure was developed to simultaneously determine
      bisphenol S, bisphenol F, bisphenol B, bisphenol A, bisphenol AF,
      tetrachlorobisphenol A, and tetrabromobisphenol A in reed and
      Callitrichaceae. Homogenized samples were extracted with acetonitrile and
      purified using an ENVI&trade;-Carb cartridge followed by an NH2 cartridge.
      The analytes were separated and quantified by ultra performance liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The recoveries at
      three fortified levels in reed and Callitrichaceae were 57-108% and
      68-106%, respectively, with relative standard deviations of no more than
      15% (n=6). The method limits of quantification and detection for the seven
      bisphenol analogues were 0.005-0.500&mu;g/kg and 0.002-0.150&mu;g/kg,
      respectively. This method was used to analyze the seven compounds in ten
      reed and Callitrichaceae samples collected from Zhejiang, China.

ABSTRACT:
      This article presents a simple and universal analytical method for the
      simultaneous analysis of bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol A
      (BPA), bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol AF (BPAF), tetrachlorobisphenol A
      (TCBPA), and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in environmental water (river
      water, sewage) and solid samples (sediment, sludge) based on liquid
      chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Analytes
      were extracted from water samples using hydrophilic lipophilic balanced
      (HLB) solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, and the extracts were
      further purified using MAX SPE cartridges. For the solid samples, a
      combination of ultrasonic extraction with the same SPE clean-up procedures
      used for the water samples was employed. The absolute recoveries for all
      analytes in the water and solid samples ranged from 57.1 to 114.3%. Good
      method reproducibility was achieved in terms of intra- and inter-day
      precision, yielding relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 16.9 and
      18.1%, respectively. The method limits of quantitation (MLOQ) for the
      seven compounds in environmental water and solid samples ranged from 0.05
      to 4.35ng/L and from 0.06 to 2.83ng/g (dry weight, d.w.), respectively.
      Finally, this method was successfully applied to real environmental sample
      analysis, which revealed that all of the tested BPs were present, with the
      exception of BPB.

ABSTRACT:
      Extensive use of bisphenol A and its analogues has caused increasing
      concern over the potential adverse health impacts of these chemicals. In
      this study, the presence and profiles of 13 bisphenols (BPs) were
      investigated in 52 municipal sewage sludge samples collected from 30
      cities in China. Tetrabromobisphenol A was the most frequently observed
      analogue (geometric mean: 20.5 ng/g dw). Bisphenol A (4.69 ng/g dw),
      bisphenol S (3.02 ng/g dw), and bisphenol F (3.84 ng/g dw) were found with
      similar frequency. Other BP analogues such as tetrachlorobisphenol A,
      bisphenol AF, bisphenol E, and dihydroxybiphenyl were identified for the
      first time in sewage sludge in China. Significant correlations were found
      among BP concentrations, but no relationships were found with wastewater
      treatment plant characteristics. Profiles of the relative estradiol
      equivalents suggested that the estrogenic potential of BP mixtures may be
      associated with the occurrence and contributions of specific analogues.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high-production-volume chemical that is widely used
      in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy food-can coatings. Following several
      studies that have reported adverse effects of BPA over the past decade,
      other bisphenol analogues, such as bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS),
      bisphenol AF (BPAF), and bisphenol B (BPB), have been gradually developed
      as substitutes for BPA in several applications. Nevertheless, few studies
      have reported on the occurrence of compounds other than BPA in foodstuffs.
      In this study, 289 food samples (13 categories: cereals and cereal
      products, meat and meat products, fish and seafood, eggs, milk and milk
      products, bean products, fruits, vegetables, cookies/snacks, beverages,
      cooking oils, condiments, and others), collected from nine cities in
      China, were analysed for eight bisphenol analogues using high-performance
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). BPA and BPF
      were found widely in foodstuffs at concentrations ranging from below the
      limit of quantitation (LOQ) to 299 ng g(-1) (mean = 4.94 ng g(-1)) and
      from below the LOQ to 623 ng g(-1) (mean = 2.50 ng g(-1)), fresh weight,
      respectively. The highest total concentrations of bisphenols (&sum;BPs:
      sum of eight bisphenols) were found in the category of vegetables that
      included canned products (mean = 27.0 ng g(-1)), followed by fish and
      seafood (16.5 ng g(-1)) and beverages (15.6 ng g(-1)). &sum;BP
      concentrations (mean = 2-3 ng g(-1)) in milk and milk products, cooking
      oils, and eggs were low. Food samples sold in metallic cans contained
      higher mean &sum;BP concentrations (56.9 ng g(-1)) in comparison with
      those packaged in glass (0.43 ng g(-1)), paper (11.9 ng g(-1)), or plastic
      (6.40 ng g(-1)). The daily dietary intakes of bisphenols were estimated,
      based on the mean concentrations measured and daily consumption rates of
      foods, to be 646 and 664 ng kg(-1) bw day(-1) for men and women,
      respectively.

ABSTRACT:
      The high reactivity of bisphenol A (BPA) with disinfectant chlorine is
      evident in the instantaneous formation of chlorinated BPA derivatives
      (ClxBPA) in various environmental media that show increased
      estrogen-activity when compared with that of BPA. The documented health
      risks associated with BPA exposures have led to the gradual market entry
      of BPA structural analogs, such as bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF),
      bisphenol B (BPB), etc. A suite of exposure sources to ClxBPA and BPA
      analogs in the domestic environment is anticipated to drive the nature and
      range of halogenated BPA derivatives that can form when residual BPA comes
      in contact with disinfectant in tap water and/or consumer products. The
      primary objective of this review was to survey all available studies
      reporting biomonitoring protocols of ClxBPA and structural BPA analogs
      (BPS, BPF, BPB, etc.) in human matrices. Focus was paid on describing the
      analytical methodologies practiced for the analysis of ClxBPA and BPA
      analogs using hyphenated chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques,
      because current methodologies for human matrices are complex. During the
      last decade, an increasing number of ecotoxicological, cell-culture and
      animal-based and human studies dealing with ClxBPA exposure sources and
      routes of exposure, metabolism and toxicity have been published. Up to
      date findings indicated the association of ClxBPA with metabolic
      conditions, such as obesity, lipid accumulation, and type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, particularly in in-vitro and in-vivo studies. We critically
      discuss the limitations, research needs and future opportunities linked
      with the inclusion of ClxBPA and BPA analogs into exposure assessment
      protocols of relevant epidemiological studies.

ABSTRACT:
      Structural analogs of bisphenol A are commonly used as its alternatives in
      industrial and commercial applications. Nevertheless, the question arises
      whether the use of other bisphenols is justified as replacements for
      bisphenol A in mass production of plastic materials. To evaluate the
      influence of metabolic reactions on endocrine activities of bisphenols, we
      conducted a systematic review of the literature. Knowledge about the
      metabolic pathways and enzymes involved in metabolic biotransformations is
      essential for understanding and predicting mechanisms of toxicity.
      Bisphenols are metabolized predominantly by the glucuronidation reaction,
      which is considered their most important detoxification pathway, as based
      on current knowledge, glucuronides do not have activity on endocrine
      receptors. In contrast, several oxidative metabolites of bisphenols with
      enhanced endocrine activities are presented, and these findings indicate
      that oxidative metabolites of bisphenols can still have endocrine
      activities in humans.

ABSTRACT:
      In an electronics plant, 2 one-component epoxy coatings containing a
      modified polyamine hardener were used as covering materials for protecting
      important information on police radio circuit boards. The resinous parts
      of the coatings consisted of epoxy resins based on diglycidyl ether of
      bisphenol F. The hardener was a dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA)-epoxy
      adduct and contained about 0.16% free DMAPA. Of 105 workers, 17 (16%) were
      diagnosed to have work-related dermatitis but were not patch tested. The
      hands were the commonly affected region (13 out of 17 cases). The latent
      period of dermatitis was very short (mean 21.5 days). The work-related
      dermatoses were closely related to the type of work and working periods.
      In the present study, hand protection and the introduction of automation
      have been demonstrated to be useful for the prevention of epoxy coating
      dermatitis.

ABSTRACT:
      The efficacy of two rhizobacteria (Sphingobium fuliginis TIK1 and
      Sphingobium sp. IT4) of Phragmites australis for the sustainable treatment
      of water polluted with phenolic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) was
      investigated. Strains TIK1 and IT4 have recently been isolated from
      Phragmites rhizosphere and shown to degrade various 4-alkylphenols-TIK1
      via phenolic ring hydroxylation and meta-cleavage and IT4 via
      ipso-hydroxylation. The two strains also degraded bisphenol A (BPA),
      bisphenol B, bisphenol E, bisphenol F, bisphenol P and bisphenol S (BPS).
      Thus, strains TIK1 and IT4 have wide degradation spectra for phenolic
      EDCs. The two strains utilized Phragmites root extracts as a sole carbon
      source and sustainably colonized Phragmites roots, where they degraded
      phenolic EDCs. In sequencing batch reactor experiments using Phragmites in
      association with TIK1 or IT4, both associations repeatedly removed
      phenolic EDCs from polluted secondary effluent water (BPA, BPS,
      4-tert-butylphenol, 4-tert-octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol) from polluted
      secondary effluent water. The results suggest that hydroponic systems
      using Phragmites-TIK and Phragmites-IT4 associations would be useful for
      sustainable treatment of polluted waters containing various phenolic EDCs.

ABSTRACT:
      Due to their growing consumption, ready-made meals are a major dietary
      component for many people in today's society, representing an important
      potential route of human exposure to several food contaminants. The recent
      restrictions in the use of bisphenol A have led the plastic industry to
      look for alternative chemicals, most of them belonging to the same family
      of p,p'-bisphenols. The aim of the current work was to develop and
      validate a method based on stable-isotope dilution liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of bisphenol A
      and its main analogs - bisphenol S, 4,4'-sulfonylbis(2-methylphenol),
      bisphenol F, bisphenol E, bisphenol B, bisphenol Z, bisphenol AF,
      bisphenol AP, tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol P - in solid foodstuffs,
      and particularly in ready-made meals. Extraction was carried out by
      ultrasound-assisted extraction after sample disruption with sand. A
      selective solid-phase extraction procedure was then applied to reduce
      potential matrix interferences. Derivatization of bisphenols with
      pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride increased their ionization efficiency by
      electrospray ionization. Validation of the proposed method was performed
      in terms of selectivity, matrix effects, linearity, precision, measurement
      uncertainty, trueness and limits of detection. Satisfactory repeatability
      and intermediate precision were obtained; the related relative standard
      deviations were &le;7.8% and &le;10%, respectively. The relative expanded
      uncertainty (k=2) was below 17% for all bisphenol analogs and the trueness
      of the method was demonstrated by spike recovery experiments. Low limits
      of detection, in the range from 0.025&mu;gkg(-1) to 0.140&mu;gkg(-1), were
      obtained for all compounds. To demonstrate the applicability of the
      proposed method, it was eventually applied to several ready-made meals
      purchased from different supermarkets in Belgium.

ABSTRACT:
      The study of epoxy resin composed of bisphenol A diglycidylether (BADGE),
      bisphenol F diglycidylether (BFDGE) (base), and primary aliphatic
      polyamines (hardener), has confirmed the interest of measuring certain
      physical parameters in order to evaluate the density of cross-linking of
      the network and thus predict the risks of resin molecules migrating into
      foodstuffs. This suggestion had been made in a preceding study on an epoxy
      resin composed of bisphenol A diglycidylether (BADGE) and primary aromatic
      polyamines. Samples with different densities of cross-linking, obtained by
      subjecting the resin to different curing temperatures (5, 20, 50 and 90
      degrees C) for 7 days, were studied. The density of cross-linking
      increased with curing temperature, as indicated by the increase in glass
      transition temperature, the increased stability of the rubber storage
      modulus E'rub (increase in cross-link nodes), the fall in relaxation
      enthalpies (reduction in physical ageing) and the decreased amplitude of
      the loss-factor tan delta (reduction in chain mobility). Maximum
      cross-linking was obtained in the resin cured at 90 degrees C (temperature
      above Tg infinity). Concurrently, tests of migration into different liquid
      food simultants (distilled water, distilled water/ethanol/acetic acid,
      distilled water/ethanol) revealed a considerable reduction in specific
      migrations of BADGE and BFDGE, and of unidentified peaks.

ABSTRACT:
      A simple and robust scheme is proposed for the fabrication of nanoscale
      (20 nm line width) and high-aspect-ratio (9:1) structures by using
      modulus-tunable UV curable epoxy resists. Additionally, the ability to
      control the Young's modulus of the imprinted material from hard to
      rigiflex using these epoxy resists is demonstrated. The physical
      properties of the new epoxy resists were controlled by adjusting the ratio
      of bisphenol F-type epoxy resin and acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber-based
      epoxy resin in the formulation of the resist. The mechanical properties of
      the resist were tuned to obtain various aspect ratios as well as mold
      flexibility for conformal contact over non-planar surfaces and large
      areas. In order to reduce the line width of the imprinted patterns, a
      process to conformally coat the mold structure by atomic layer deposition
      of alumina was also developed. Narrow lines with high-aspect-ratio
      features and with very low defect density were achieved via the new
      approach and the high mechanical strength of the new resist formulation.

ABSTRACT:
      Because of regulatory actions and public concerns, the use of bisphenol A
      (BPA) may decrease, while the use of BPA alternatives may increase.
      Although BPA alternatives are considered safer than BPA, their effects on
      health are still largely unknown. For risk assessment, understanding
      exposure to these chemicals is necessary. We measured the urinary
      concentrations of BPA and three bisphenol analogs, bisphenol S (BPS),
      bisphenol F (BPF), and bisphenol AF (BPAF), in 616 archived samples
      collected from convenience samplings of U.S. adults at eight time points
      between 2000 and 2014. We detected BPA at the highest frequency and
      geometric mean (GM) concentrations (74-99%, 0.36-2.07 &mu;g/L), followed
      by BPF (42-88%, 0.15-0.54 &mu;g/L) and BPS (19-74%,   <  0.1-0.25
      &mu;g/L); BPAF was rarely detected (  < 3% of all samples). Although
      concentrations of BPF were generally lower than for other bisphenols, the
      95th percentile concentration of BPF was often comparable or higher than
      that of BPA. We did not observe obvious exposure trends for BPF. However,
      the significant changes in GM concentrations of BPA and BPS suggest that
      exposures may be declining (BPA) or on the rise (BPS). Nationally
      representative data will be useful to confirm these findings and to allow
      monitoring future exposure trends to BPA and some of its bisphenol
      alternatives.

ABSTRACT:
      Consumer concerns about exposure to substances found in food contact
      materials with estrogenic activity (EA) have created substantial demand
      for alternatives. We assessed the potential EA of both a new bisphenol
      monomer used to synthesize polymeric coatings for metal food-contact
      applications and the nonintentionally added substances (NIAS) that may
      migrate into food. We evaluated tetramethyl bisphenol F (TMBPF) using in
      vitro and in vivo assays. We extracted the polymeric coating using food
      simulants ethanol (50% v/v) and acetic acid (3% w/v) and measured
      migration using tandem liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS)
      and LC time-of-flight MS for TMBPF and NIAS, respectively. We also tested
      migrants for EA using the E-SCREEN assay. TMBPF did not show estrogenic
      activity in the uterotrophic assay and did not alter puberty in male and
      female rats or mammary gland development in female rats. Neither TMBPF nor
      the migrants from the final polymeric coating increased proliferation of
      estrogen-sensitive MCF7 cells. TMBPF did not show estrogen-agonist or
      antagonist activity in the estrogen receptor-transactivation assay. TMBPF
      migration was below the 0.2 parts per billion detection limit. Our
      findings provide compelling evidence for the absence of EA by TMBPF and
      the polymeric coating derived from it and that human exposure to TMBPF
      would be negligible.

ABSTRACT:
      STUDY QUESTION: Are bisphenol A (BPA) and BPA analogs (BPA-A) safe for
      male human reproductive function?

      SUMMARY ANSWER: The endocrine function of human testes explants [assessed
      by measuring testosterone and insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3)] was impacted
      by exposure of the human adult testis explants to BPA/BPA-A.

      WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The few epidemiologic studies performed suggest
      that bisphenols have potential endocrine disruptive properties, but they
      did not identify clear and direct patterns of endocrine disruption.

      STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Adult human testis explants in culture were
      exposed to BPA and the analogs bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS),
      bisphenol E (BPE), bisphenol B (BPB) and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether
      (BADGE) at 10-9-10-5M for 24 or 48 h.

      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Human adult testes were obtained
      from prostate cancer patients who had no hormone therapy, or from
      multiorgan donors. After ex vivo exposure to the investigated bisphenols,
      the measured outcomes were related to histopathology (gross morphology and
      germ cell viability determined by anti-caspase three
      immunohistochemistry), and the levels of testosterone, INSL3 and inhibin B
      were measured using immunoassays. The levels of mRNA encoding key enzymes
      of bisphenol biotransformation were investigated by quantitative PCR:
      UGT2B15 UDP (glucuronosyltransferase two family, polypeptide B15), GUSB
      (glucuronidase beta), SULT1A1and 3 (sulfotransferase family 1 A member 1
      and 3) and STS (steroid sulfatase).

      MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A significant dose-dependent
      inhibition was found between testosterone levels measured in the culture
      medium and concentrations of BPA (P = 0.00778 at 24 h and P = 0.0291 at 48
      h), BPE (P = 0.039) and BPF (P = 0.00663). The observed BPA and
      BPA-A-induced inhibition of testosterone production varied according to
      duration of exposure and BPA/BPA-A concentrations. BPA (10-9M; P   < 
      0.05), BPB (10-9M; P   <  0.05), BPS (10-9 and 10-8 M; P   <  0.05) and
      BADGE (10-5 M; P   <  0.05) increased Leydig cell INSL3 production. By
      contrast, BPE dose dependently inhibited INSL3 (P = 0.0372). Conversely,
      Sertoli cell function (inhibin B) and germ cell viability were not
      significantly affected by either bisphenols.

LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A.

      LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Environmental compounds cannot be
      deliberately administered to men, justifying the use of an ex vivo
      approach. A relatively low number of testes samples were available for
      analysis (n = 3, except for testosterone secretion with n = 5). The active
      concentrations of BPA and BPA-A used in the study were higher than those
      found in human biological fluids.

      WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Under our experimental conditions,
      direct exposure to BPA or BPA-A can result in endocrine disturbance in the
      adult human testis.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting compound that may have
      adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune system
      effects. Low-level exposure to BPA is ubiquitous in human populations due
      to its widespread use in consumer products. Therefore, highly sensitive
      methods are needed to quantify BPA in various matrices including water,
      serum, and food products. In this study, we developed a simple, rapid,
      highly sensitive and specific sensor based on an aptamer probe and AC
      electrokinetics capacitive sensing method that successfully detected BPA
      at femto molar (fM) levels, which is an improvement over prior work by a
      factor of 10. We were able to detect BPA spiked in human serum as well as
      in maternal and cord blood within 30s. The sensor is responsive to BPA
      down to femto molar levels, but not to structurally similar compounds
      including bisphenol F (BPF) or bisphenol S (BPS) even at much higher
      concentration. Further development of this platform may prove useful in
      monitoring exposure to BPA and other small molecules in various matrices.

ABSTRACT:
      As the concern over the safety of bisphenol A (BPA) continues to grow,
      this compound is gradually being replaced, in industrial applications,
      with compounds such as bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS). Occurrence
      of bisphenols, including BPA and BPS, has been reported in paper products
      and in environmental matrices. Information on the occurrence of
      bisphenols, other than BPA, in foodstuffs, however, is scarce. In this
      study, several bisphenol analogues, including BPA, BPF, and BPS, were
      analyzed in foodstuffs (N = 267) collected from Albany, NY, USA, using
      high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
      (HPLC-MS/MS). Foodstuffs were divided into nine categories of beverages,
      dairy products, fats and oils, fish and seafood, cereals, meat and meat
      products, fruits, vegetables, and "others". Bisphenols were found in the
      majority (75%) of the food samples, and the total concentrations of
      bisphenols (&Sigma;BPs: sum of eight bisphenols) were in the range of
      below the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 1130 ng/g fresh weight, with an
      overall mean value of 4.38 ng/g. The highest overall mean concentration of
      &Sigma;BPs was found in the "others" category, which included condiments
      (preserved, ready-to-serve foods). A sample of mustard (dressing) and
      ginger, placed in the category of vegetables, contained the highest
      concentrations of 1130 ng/g for bisphenol F (BPF) and 237 ng/g for
      bisphenol P (BPP). Concentrations of BPs in beverages (mean = 0.341 ng/g)
      and fruits (0.698 ng/g) were low. The predominant bisphenol analogues
      found in foodstuffs were BPA and BPF, which accounted for 42 and 17% of
      the total BP concentrations, respectively. Canned foods contained higher
      concentrations of individual and total bisphenols in comparison to foods
      sold in glass, paper, or plastic containers. On the basis of measured
      concentrations and daily ingestion rates of foods, the daily dietary
      intakes of bisphenols (calculated from the mean concentration) were
      estimated to be 243, 142, 117, 63.6, and 58.6 ng/kg body weight (bw)/day
      for toddlers, infants, children, teenagers, and adults, respectively.

ABSTRACT:
      BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Three methods are described for the analysis
      of BADGE, BFDGE and their derivatives with water or hydrochloric acid. The
      principal method involved extraction of the components into an aqueous
      phase containing 50% ethanol and analysis by RPLC with fluorescence
      detection (FD). With the exception of the epoxy compounds in oily foods,
      results were accurate within an estimated 20%. For individual compounds,
      the lower limit of quantitation was 20 mug/kg. Owing to occasional
      co-chromatography with food components, positive results were confirmed by
      extraction of the food homogenates with MTBE, acetylation and normal phase
      HPLC (NPLC)-FD. With this method, some 60-95% of the true values were
      obtained. In the case of disagreement, fractions from NPLC were analyzed
      by GC-MS using large volume on-column injection.

ABSTRACT:
      A monitoring program was developed for the environmental analysis of four
      phenols and three phenoxyacid herbicides in natural surface and ground
      water samples from the vineyard region of La Rioja (Spain). An analytical
      method based on molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction was developed
      for the determination of the impact of these compounds on the quality of
      environmental water samples. Different parameters were evaluated and
      optimized to achieve limits of detection in the 20-90 ng L(-1) range for
      both surface and ground water, with relative standard deviations in the
      12-18% range. A comparative study of the behavior of the imprinted polymer
      compared with traditional sorbents (C18 and Oasis HLB) in the analysis of
      river water was performed. The results revealed that bisphenol-A is the
      most ubiquitous compound (present in more than 50% of the samples), with
      values up to 0.72 &mu;g L(-1). Bisphenol-F was also detected in several
      samples (33% of the samples), although in concentration lower than
      Bisphenol-A. The herbicide 2,4-D was frequently detected in water samples
      (present in 33% of the samples), with concentrations above 0.1 &mu;g L(-1)
      in two samples.

ABSTRACT:
      BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The characterization of complex mixtures of
      organic contaminants present in industrial effluents is a well-known
      problem. The determination of individual target analytes depends very much
      on the analytical method used. In this article, the possibilities of using
      high-temperature gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HT-GC-MS) are
      explored. In HT-GC-MS non-polar and medium-polarity phases can be operated
      at temperatures up to 370-420ÍC, allowing the analysis of
      high-molecular-weight compounds.  So far, the applications of HT-GC have
      included the analysis of hydrocarbons up to C-100, lipids, sugars, and
      polyglycerols, but no data have been reported on the characterization of
      organic pollutants present in industrial effluents. The general sample
      handling approach reported here is based either on a sequential
      solid-phase extraction (SSPE) procedure, with a change of solvent
      composition in the elution from two different cartridges (C18 and
      Lichrolut EN), or on a toxicological

ABSTRACT:
      Both fibril and spherical polyaniline (PANI) nanostructures have
      successfully served as nanofillers for obtaining epoxy resin polymer
      nanocomposites (PNCs). The effects of nanofiller morphology and loading
      level on the mechanical properties, rheological behaviors, thermal
      stability, flame retardancy, electrical conductivity, and dielectric
      properties were systematically studied. The introduction of the PANI
      nanofillers was found to reduce the heat-release rate and to increase the
      char residue of epoxy resin. A reduced viscosity was observed in both
      types of PANI-epoxy resin liquid nanosuspension samples at lower loadings
      (1.0 wt&thinsp;% for PANI nanospheres; 1.0 and 3.0 wt&thinsp;% for PANI
      nanofibers), the viscosity was increased with further increases in the
      PANI loading for both morphologies. The dynamic storage and loss modulii
      were studied, together with the glass-transition temperature (T(g)) being
      obtained from the peak of tan &delta;. The critical PANI nanofiller
      loading for the modulus and T(g) was different, i.e., 1.0 wt&thinsp;% for
      the nanofibers and 5.0 wt&thinsp;% for the nanospheres. The percolation
      thresholds of the PANI nanostructures were identified with the dynamic
      mechanical property and electrical conductivity, and, because of the
      higher aspect ratio, nanofibers reached the percolation threshold at a
      lower loading (3.0 wt&thinsp;%) than the PANI nanospheres (5.0
      wt&thinsp;%). The PANI nanofillers could increase the electrical
      conductivity, and, at the same loading, the epoxy nanocomposites with the
      PANI nanofibers showed lower volume resistivity than the nanocomposites
      with the PANI nanospheres, which were discussed with the contact
      resistance and percolation threshold. The tensile test indicated an
      improved tensile strength of the epoxy matrix with the introduction of the
      PANI nanospheres at a lower loading (1.0 wt&thinsp;%). Compared with pure
      epoxy, the elasticity modulus was increased for all the PNC samples.
      Moreover, further studies on the fracture surface revealed an enhanced
      toughness. Finally, the real permittivity was observed to increase with
      increasing the PANI loading, and the enhanced permittivity was analyzed by
      the interfacial polarization.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol analogues are a group of chemicals which are being widely
      applied in industrial and household products owing to regulations on
      bisphenol A (BPA) in many countries. In this study, an analytical method,
      including extraction from complex environmental matrices, clean-up using
      solid phase extraction (SPE) and following-up derivatization prior to gas
      chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), was developed to
      analyze seven commonly used bisphenols in sediment. Five kinds of
      extraction solvents, four kinds of SPE cartridges, and four kinds of SPE
      eluting solvents were individually tested for their performances; and the
      conditions for derivatizing were also optimized. Finally, C18 cartridge
      was determined as the SPE cartridge and methanol was selected as
      extracting and eluting solvent. Acetic anhydride (AA) was used as
      derivatizing agent and reaction took 20      min      at room temperature.
      The method was used successfully to measure the seven bisphenol compounds
      in sediment samples from Taihu Lake, China. BPA, bisphenol F and bisphenol
      S were detected in all sediment samples, with concentrations in the range
      of 3.94-33.2; 0.503-3.28 and 0.323-27.3      ng      g-1 dw. Other
      compounds were detected at low frequencies or not detected. We provided a
      convenient, reliable, and sensitive method to analyze bisphenol compounds
      in complex environmental samples.

ABSTRACT:
      Off-line SPE and CE coupled with electrochemical detection have been used
      for the determination of bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F, 4-ethylphenol,
      and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether in bottled drinking water. The use of
      boron-doped diamond electrode as an electrochemical detector in
      amperometric mode that provides a favorable analytical performance for
      detecting these endocrine-disrupting compounds, such as lower noise
      levels, higher peak resolution with enhanced sensitivity, and improved
      resistance against electrode passivation. The oxidative electrochemical
      detection of the endocrine-disrupting compounds was accomplished by
      boron-doped diamond electrode poised at +1.4 V versus Ag/AgCl without
      electrode pretreatment. An off-line SPE procedure (Bond Elut&reg; C18 SPE
      cartridge) was utilized to extract and preconcentrate the compounds prior
      to separation and detection. The minimum concentration detectable for all
      four compounds ranged from 0.01 to 0.06 &mu;M, having S/N equal to three.
      After exposing the plastic bottle water container under sunlight for 7
      days, the estimated concentration of BPA in the bottled drinking water was
      estimated to be 0.03 &mu;M. This proposed approach has great potential for
      rapid and effective determination of BPA content present in water
      packaging of plastic bottles that have been exposed to sunlight for an
      extended period of time.

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 2010, wind energy coverage in Spain
      increased by 16%, making the country the world's fourth largest producer
      in a fast-developing industry that is also a source of employment.
      Occupational skin diseases in this field have received little attention.
      The present study aims to describe the main characteristics of skin
      diseases affecting workers in the wind energy industry and the allergens
      involved.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a descriptive, observational study of
      workers from the wind energy industry with suspected contact dermatitis
      who were referred to the occupational dermatology clinic of the National
      School of Occupational Medicine (Escuela Nacional de Medicina del Trabajo)
      between 2009 and 2011. We took both a clinical history and an occupational
      history, and patients underwent a physical examination and patch testing
      with the materials used in their work.

      RESULTS: We studied 10 workers (8 men, 2 women), with a mean age of 33.7
      years. The main finding was dermatitis, which affected the face, eyelids,
      forearms, and hands. Sensitization to epoxy resins was detected in 4
      workers, 1 of whom was also sensitized to epoxy curing agents. One worker
      was sensitized to bisphenol F resin but had a negative result with epoxy
      resin from the standard series. In the 5 remaining cases, the final
      diagnosis was irritant contact dermatitis due to fiberglass.

      CONCLUSIONS: Occupational skin diseases are increasingly common in the
      wind energy industry. The main allergens are epoxy resins. Fiberglass
      tends to produce irritation.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) has been shown to provoke many deleterious impacts on
      human health, and thus it is now successively substituted by BPA
      analogues, whose effects have been poorly investigated. Up to now, only
      one study has been realized to assess the effect of BPA on human
      erythrocytes, which showed its significant hemolytic and oxidative
      potential. Moreover, no study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of
      BPA analogues on red blood cells. The purpose of the present study was to
      compare the impact of BPA and its selected analogues such as bisphenol F
      (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol AF (BPAF) on hemolytic and
      morphological changes and hemoglobin oxidation (methemoglobin formation)
      of human erythrocytes. The erythrocytes were incubated with different
      bisphenols concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 500&mu;g/ml for 1, 4 and
      24h. The compounds examined caused hemolysis in human erythrocytes with
      BPAF exhibiting the strongest effect. All bisphenols examined caused
      methemoglobin formation with BPA inducing the strongest oxidative
      potential. Flow cytometry analysis showed that all bisphenols (excluding
      BPS) induced significant changes in erythrocytes size. Changes in red
      blood cells shape were conducted using phase contrast microscopy. It was
      noticed that BPA and BPAF induced echinocytosis, BPF caused
      stomatocytosis, while BPS did not provoke significant changes in shape of
      red blood cells. Generally, the results showed that BPS, which is the main
      substituent of bisphenol A in polymers and thermal paper production,
      exhibited significantly lower disturbance of erythrocyte functions than
      BPA.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol analogues are used in the production of polycarbonate plastics
      and epoxy resins. Despite the widespread use of bisphenols, few studies
      have reported the occurrence of compounds other than bisphenol A (BPA) in
      sediment. In this study, concentrations and profiles of eight bisphenol
      analogues were determined using high-performance liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) in sediments
      collected from several industrialized areas in the United States (U.S.),
      Japan, and Korea. The total concentrations of bisphenols (&Sigma;BPs; sum
      of eight bisphenols) in sediment ranged from below the limit of
      quantitation (LOQ) to 25,300 ng/g dry weight (dw), with a mean value of
      201 ng/g dw. Sediment samples from Lake Shihwa, Korea, contained the
      highest concentrations of both individual and total bisphenols. Among
      individual bisphenols, BPA and bisphenol F (BPF) were the predominant
      compounds, accounting for 64% and 30% of the total bisphenol
      concentrations in sediment. We also examined vertical profiles of
      concentrations of bisphenol analogues in sediment cores from the U.S. and
      Japan. Sediment cores from the U.S. showed a gradual decline in the
      concentrations of bisphenols as compared to the past decade. BPA
      concentrations were found to decline in a sediment core from Tokyo Bay,
      but bisphenol S (BPS) was more frequently detected in core sections that
      represent the most recent decade, which is consistent with the replacement
      of BPA with BPS in some applications since 2001 in Japan.

ABSTRACT:
      BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  An overview is presented of the potential
      for bioremediation of a range of contaminated sites. Most of the compounds
      belong to groups that are widespread and are generally persistent or
      toxic. Although attention has been focused on microbiological aspects of
      their application, it is pointed out that a successful programme requires
      integrated input from geologists, engineers, chemists and microbiologists.
      It is emphasized that a protocol must be available for evaluating the
      success of the  procedures that have been implemented. Attention is
      directed to critical issues, including partial degradation, formation of
      metabolites, and recalcitrance of specific components in complex mixtures.
      An attempt is made to discuss the basic aspects of the biodegradation of
      components specific to the various sites and to illustrate the outcome of
      experiments in bioremediation in laboratory-based, pilot-scale or
      full-scale field operations. Brief discussion is given of some less
      commonly p

ABSTRACT:
      Rehabilitation of aged drinking water pipes is an extensive renovation and
      increasingly topical in many European cities. Spray-on-lining of drinking
      water pipes is an alternative cost-effective rehabilitation technology in
      which the insides of pipes are relined with organic polymer. A commonly
      used polymer is epoxy resin consisting of monomer bisphenol A (BPA).
      Leaching of BPA from epoxy lining to drinking water has been a concern
      among public and authorities. Currently epoxy lining is not recommended in
      some countries. BPA leaching has been demonstrated in laboratory studies
      but the behavior and ageing process of epoxy lining in situ is not well
      known. In this study 6 locations with different age epoxy linings of
      drinking water pipes done using two distinct technologies were studied.
      While bisphenol F, 4-n-nonylphenol, and 4-t-octylphenol were rarely found
      and in trace concentrations, BPA was detected in majority of samples.
      Pipes lined with the older technology (LSE) leached more BPA than those
      with more recent technology (DonPro): maxima in cold water were
      0.25      &mu;g/L and 10      ng/L, respectively. Incubation of water in
      pipes 8-10      h prior to sampling increased BPA concentration in cold
      water 1.1-43-fold. Hot water temperature caused even more BPA leaching -
      at maximum 23.5      &mu;g/L. The influence of ageing of epoxy lining on
      BPA leaching on could be shown in case of LSE technology: locations with
      8-9 years old lining leached 4-20-fold more BPA compared to a location
      with 2-year-old lining. Analysis of metals showed that epoxy lining can
      reduce especially iron concentration in water. No significant burden to
      water could be shown by the analyzed 72 volatile organic compounds,
      including epichlorhydrin, precursor used in epoxy resin. Estrogenicity was
      detected in water samples with the highest BPA loads. Comparable responses
      of two yeast bioreporters (estrogen receptor &alpha; and BPA-targeted)
      indicated that bisphenol-like compounds were the main cause of
      estrogenicity. Compared to the estimated average daily BPA exposure,
      additional BPA load via cold drinking water in the studied locations was
      low, maximum 8.7%. However, hot water should also be considered as
      exposure source due to higher BPA concentrations. Epoxy lined locations
      should be monitored in future in order to evaluate ageing process and
      control increasing leaching of potentially harmful chemicals.

ABSTRACT:
      BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The study of epoxy resin composed of
      bisphenol A diglycidylether (BADGE), bisphenol F diglycidylether (BFDGE)
      (base), and primary aliphatic polyamines (hardener), has confirmed the
      interest of measuring certain physical parameters in order to evaluate the
      density of cross-linking of the network and thus predict the risks of
      resin molecules migrating into foodstuffs. This suggestion had been made
      in a preceding study on an epoxy resin composed of bisphenol A
      diglycidylether (BADGE) and primary  aromatic polyamines. Samples with
      different densities of cross-linking, obtained by subjecting the resin to
      different curing temperatures (5, 20, 50 and 90ÍC) for 7 days, were
      studied. The density of cross-linking increased with curing temperature,
      as indicated by the increase in glass transition temperature, the
      increased stability of the rubber storage modulus E'rub increase in
      cross-link nodes), the fall in relaxation enthalpies (reduction in
      physical ageing) and the decreased a

ABSTRACT:
      BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The chemical, structure of hydroxylated
      diphenylalkanes or bisphenols consists of two phenolic rings joined
      together through a bridging carbon. This class of endocrine disruptors
      that mimic estrogens is widely used in industry, particularly in plastics.
      Bisphenol F, bisphenol A, fluorine-containing bisphenol A (bisphenol AF),
      and other diphenylalkanes were found to be estrogenic in a bioassay with
      MCF7 human breast cancer cells in culture (E-SCREEN assay). Bisphenols
      promoted cell proliferation  and increased the synthesis and secretion of
      cell type-specific proteins. When ranked by proliferative potency, the
      longer the alkyl substituent at the bridging carbon, the lower the
      concentration needed for maximal cell yield; the most active compound
      contained two propyl chains at the bridging carbon. Bisphenols with two
      hydroxyl groups in the para position and an angular configuration are
      suitable for appropriate hydrogen bonding to the acceptor site of the
      estrogen receptor.

ABSTRACT:
      Endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs), which are predominantly present in
      the environment, are able to mimic or antagonise the biological activity
      of hormones primarily through the interaction with specific receptors. The
      main consequences are adverse effects on the growth and development of
      reproductive organs, the induction of cancer and effects on neuronal
      differentiation. In this study, we investigated the ability of certain
      EDCs, Bisphenol A (BPA), Bisphenol B (BPB), Bisphenol F (BPF), 4-n
      Nonylphenol (NP) and Octylphenol (OP), belonging to a homogeneous group of
      phenol origin, to interfere with specific cellular processes, namely,
      proliferation, by using MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, and differentiation,
      by using murine bone marrow dendritic cells. We correlated the data on
      cell growth with the stimulation of cell cycle progression, which could
      become a step in the development of cancer, and we established a
      proliferation ranking between the tested EDCs:
      NP  > BPA  > OP  > BPB  > BPF. In addition, we investigated the ability of
      NP, BPA and OP to induce the differentiation of dendritic cells, the
      powerful antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. The
      differentiation and activation of these cells could affect a
      well-regulated immune response and determine an allergic sensitisation. We
      found that BPA and NP were active in determining differentiation.

ABSTRACT:
      The effects of various bisphenols, especially bisphenol-A, structurally
      related to diethylstilbestrol, on microtubule assembly and micronucleus
      formation were examined in order to determine their aneuploidogenic
      potential.  Microtubule proteins (MTPs) obtained from bovine brain were
      incubated with 20 to 200 micromolar (microM) doses of
      2,2-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)propane (80057) (BPA), bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)methane
      (2467029) (BP2), p,p'-dihydroxybenzophenone (611994) (BP3),
      2,2-bis(m-methyl-p-hydroxyphenyl)propane (79970) (BP4), and
      2,2-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)perfluoropropane (1478611) (BP5) for 20 minutes
      prior to the activation of microtubule assembly by the addition of
      guanosine-triphosphate.  Increased turbidity was measured for 30 minutes. 
      Microtubule assemblies were examined using electron microscopy. 
      Chinese-hamster-V79 lung fibroblasts were cultured with various
      concentrations of the test compounds for 6 hours.  The cytotoxicity of the
      compounds was determined using the trypan-blue assay.  Fluorescence
      microscopy was used to determine mitotic arrest, microtubule
      abnormalities, and micronuclei formation in exposed cells.  In MTP
      incubations, BPA, BP4, and BP5 caused significant decreases in microtubule
      assembly.  Neither BP2 nor BP3 had any effect on microtubule assembly. 
      The depolymerization of MTP was inhibited by exposure to BPA and BP5. 
      Microtubules exposed to BPA, BP4, and BP5 exhibited uncharacteristic
      spiral structures, which did not disappear upon cooling.  V79 cells
      exposed to BPA, BP4, and BP5 displayed significant reductions in the
      cytoplasmic microtubule complex, compared to controls.  Mitotic spindle
      abnormalities were found in cells exposed to BPA, BP3, BP4, and BP5. 
      Relative to controls, the number of dead cells was increased in cultures
      exposed to high doses of BPA, BP3, BP4, and BP5.  In addition, cell growth
      was decreased in cells exposed to BPA, BP4, and BP5.  The number of
      mitotic arrests increased in a significant, dose dependent manner in cells
      treated with BPA, BP3, BP4, and BP5.  Substantial micronuclei formation
      was induced in cells exposed to BPA, BP3, BP4, and BP5.  The authors
      conclude that BPA, BP3, BP4, and BP5 have aneuploidogenic potential, with
      BPA, BP4, and BP5 interacting with tubulin, and BP3 acting via an as yet
      undetermined mechanism.

ABSTRACT:
      Leakage of the residual template molecules is one of the biggest
      challenges for application of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) in
      solid-phase extraction (SPE). In this study, bisphenol F (BPF) was adopted
      as a dummy template to prepare MIP of bisphenol A (BPA) with a
      superparamagnetic core-shell nanoparticle as the supporter, aiming to
      avoid residual template leakage and to increase the efficiency of SPE.
      Characterization and test of the obtained products (called mag-DMIP beads)
      revealed that these novel nanoparticles not only had excellent magnetic
      property but also displayed high selectivity to the target molecule BPA.
      As mag-DMIP beads were adopted as the adsorbents of solid-phase extraction
      for detecting BPA in real water samples, the recoveries of spiked samples
      ranged from 84.7% to 93.8% with the limit of detection of 2.50 pg mL(-1),
      revealing that mag-DMIP beads were efficient SPE adsorbents.

ABSTRACT:
      A sensitive and selective gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was
      developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of bisphenol A (BPA) and
      three other bisphenols, bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol E (BPE), and
      bisphenol F (BPF). This method was used to analyze samples of 52 canned
      fish products to follow up a previous study conducted 5 years ago to
      investigate any changes in BPA levels since then and levels of other
      bisphenols due to possible changes in can coating formulations. BPB and
      BPE were not detected in any of the 52 canned fish products, and BPF was
      detected in only four products at low levels from 1.8 to 5.7 ng/g,
      indicating that BPA is likely still the dominant bisphenol used in current
      can coating formulations. BPA was detected in all 52 canned fish products,
      but at much lower levels compared with a previous study; levels ranged
      from 0.96 to 265 ng/g (average, 28 ng/g). The few products with high BPA
      levels (  > 100 ng/g) are exclusively from a new brand that has become
      available on the market only recently. Further analysis of canned fish
      products is planned in the future to capture any changes in BPA levels in
      these products and to update the exposure assessment of BPA due to
      consumption of canned fish products.

ABSTRACT:
      Epoxy resin systems are a frequent cause of occupational allergic contact
      dermatitis. A 50-year-old patient developed eczematous skin lesions on the
      back of his hands, lower arms and eye lids, two months after starting work
      in aircraft construction. Patch tests showed positive reactions to nickel
      sulfate and to epoxy resins based on the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F
      and on 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether. Triglycidyl-p-aminophenol (TGPAP)
      applied at 1% and 0.1% induced the strongest positive reaction. Four
      months later, the patient presented with two circular depigmented spots in
      the former TGPAP-patch test areas. Dermatohistopathology confirmed the
      diagnosis of contact vitiligo.

ABSTRACT:
      OBJECTIVE: To simultaneously determine the four bisphenolic compounds
      (bisphenol F, bisphenol A, tetrachlorobisphenol A and tetrabromobisphenol
      A) in drinking water by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

      METHODS: 200 ml water sample was extracted by solid-phase extraction,
      eluted with methanol and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass
      spectrometry under the MRM mode. The separation was carried out on a T3
      column (2.1 mm x 150 mm, 3 &mu;m).

      RESULTS: The limits of detection for the four bisphenolic compounds were
      in the range of 0.20 - 5.5 ng/L. The mean recoveries at the two spiked
      levels were 87.1% - 109.0% with the intra-day precision between 6.3% -
      12.4% and inter-day precision between 4.5% - 15.4%. The method was applied
      for determination of 15 water samples.

      CONCLUSION: The method was sensitive, precise and accurate.

ABSTRACT:
      Among 20 subway construction workers in Taipei, Taiwan, using a new epoxy
      resin system, nine showed clinical symptoms and signs of contact
      dermatitis. The objective of the study was to determine which components
      of the epoxy resin system were responsible for the contact allergy. Patch
      testing with the various components of the system was performed on both
      the patients and asymptomatic individuals. Findings are discussed. It is
      concluded that contact allergy to epoxy resin systems may involve
      hardeners and diluents as well as resins, and patch testing for reaction
      to all components should be performed.

ABSTRACT:
      A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), obtained by precipitation
      polymerisation with 4-vinylpyridine as the functional monomer, ethylene
      glycol dimethacrylate as cross-linker, and bisphenol-A (BPA) as template,
      was prepared. The binding site configuration of the BPA-MIP was examined
      using Scatchard analysis. Moreover, the behaviour of the BPA-MIP for the
      extraction of several phenolic compounds (bisphenol-A, bisphenol-F,
      4-nitrophenol, 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol) and phenoxyacid herbicides such as
      2,4-D, 2,4,5-T and 2,4,5-TP has been studied in organic and aqueous media
      in the presence of other pesticides in common use. It was possible to
      carry out the selective preconcentration of the target analytes from the
      organic medium with recoveries of higher than 70%. In an aqueous medium,
      hydrophobic interactions were found to exert a remarkably non-specific
      contribution to the overall binding process. Several parameters affecting
      the extraction efficiency of the BPA-MIP were evaluated to achieve the
      selective preconcentration of phenols and phenoxyacids from aqueous
      samples. The possibility of using the BPA-MIP as a selective sorbent to
      preconcentrate these compounds from other samples such as urine and river
      water was also explored.

ABSTRACT:
      We performed an immature rat uterotrophic assay of 18 chemicals and
      Hershberger assay of 30 chemicals to assess the relationship between the
      results of two assays. The chemicals tested by the uterotopic assay were
      4-n-amylphenol, p-dodecyl-phenol, p-(tert-pentyl)phenol,
      4-cyclohexylphenol, 4-(1-adamantyl)phenol, 4,4'-thiobis-phenol,
      diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine, 4-hydroxyazobenzene, 4-(phenylmethyl)phenol,
      4,4'-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphenol,
      2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-n-pentane,
      4,4'-(octahydro-4,7-methano-5H-inden-5-ylidene)bisphenol,
      4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone, 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxybenzophenone,
      4-hydroxybenzophenone, 2,4,4'-trihydroxybenzophenone, testosterone
      enanthate, and methyltestosterone. The chemicals tested by the Hershberger
      assay were the 18 chemicals tested in the uterotrophic assay plus the
      following: 17 alpha estradiol, estrone, equilin, norethindrone,
      norgestrel, ethynyl estradiol, bisphenol A, bisphenol B, bisphenol F,
      4-tert-octylphenol, p-cumyl phenol, and nonylphenol. All chemicals
      examined in this study were positive in a reporter gene assay for
      ER-alpha. In the immature rat uterotrophic assay, all chemicals induced
      uterotrophy and p-(tert-pentyl)phenol, 4,4'-thiobis-phenol,
      4-(phenylmethyl)phenol, 4,4'-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphenol,
      2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-n-pentane,
      4,4'-(octahydro-4,7-methano-5H-inden-5-ylidene)bisphenol,
      4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone, 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxybenzophenone,
      4-hydroxybenzophenone, and 2,4,4'-trihydroxybenzophenone exerted both
      estrogen agonistic effect and reduced the estrogenic effect of
      ethynylestradiol. In the Hershberger assay, a clear androgen agonistic
      effect was detected in the androgen derivatives testosterone enanthate and
      methyltestosterone.

ABSTRACT:
      Phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) have received special attention in recent
      years due to their frequent use in consumer products and potential for
      adverse effects on human health. BPA is being replaced with a number of
      alternatives, including bisphenol S, bisphenol B, bisphenol F and
      bisphenol AF. These bisphenol analogues have similar potential for adverse
      health effects, but studies on human exposure are limited. Accurate
      measurement of multiple contaminants is important for estimating exposure.
      This paper describes a sensitive and automated method for the simultaneous
      determination of 14 phthalate metabolites, BPA and four bisphenol
      analogues in urine using online solid phase extraction coupled with
      high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry using a
      hybrid triple-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer
      (LC-QTRAP-MS/MS), requiring very little sample volume (50&micro;L).
      Quantification was performed under selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode
      with negative electrospray ionization. The use of SRM combined with an
      enhanced product ion scan within the same analysis was examined.
      Unequivocal identification was provided by the acquisition of three SRM
      transitions per compound and isotope dilution. The analytical performance
      of the method was evaluated in synthetic and human urine. Linearity of
      response over three orders of magnitude was demonstrated for all of the
      compounds (R(2)  > 0.99), with method detection limits of 0.01-0.5ng/mL
      and limits of reporting of 0.07-3.1ng/mL. Accuracy ranged from 93% to 113%
      and inter- and intra-day precision were   < 22%. Finally, the validated
      method has been successfully applied to a cohort of pregnant women to
      measure biomarker concentrations of phthalates and bisphenols, with median
      concentrations ranging from 0.3ng/mL (bisphenol S) to 18.5ng/mL (monoethyl
      phthalate).

ABSTRACT:
      Steel components are typically treated with anti-corrosion coatings like
      epoxy or polyurethane resins to protect the integrity and functioning of
      steel. Such resins may contain substances, such as bisphenol A (BPA), that
      have caused concern in a human and environmental toxicological context. We
      investigated the release of toxicity from four anti-corrosion coatings
      used in hydraulic and civil engineering. Resins were applied onto glass
      plates and leachate samples produced by horizontally shaking the plates in
      water for 7 days. Two experiments were conducted, one with a 1 day and one
      with a 7 day curing period. Using a suite of bioassays, we tested samples
      for: agonistic and antagonistic effects on various mammalian nuclear
      receptors; inhibition of photosynthesis and growth in algae; inhibition of
      bacterial bioluminescence; and inhibition of water flea reproduction.
      Concentrations of BPA, bisphenol F and various BPA transformation products
      were determined by chemical analysis (LC-MS/MS). Bioassay results were
      evaluated using a scheme developed by DIBt (Centre of Competence for
      Construction, Berlin, Germany). Three products induced responses in one or
      more of the measured endpoints and toxicity profiles varied markedly in
      intensity across products. One product released high amounts of BPA which
      was associated with effects on nuclear receptor transactivation, requiring
      a more than 700-fold dilution for effect induction to fall below 20%. The
      same product was also the most toxic to water flea reproduction, requiring
      ca. 70-fold dilution for effects to fall below 20%. Another product was
      highly toxic in terms of bacterial bioluminescence, particularly after a
      shorter curing time, requiring a ca. 1'300-fold dilution for effects to
      fall below 20%. The third product required a 22-fold dilution for
      inhibition of water flea reproduction to drop below 20%. Results show that
      anti-corrosion coatings based on epoxy resins can be a source of toxicity
      to the aquatic environment. The fact that some products are more toxic
      than others highlights opportunities for the development of low risk
      formulations and products with better environmental performance. Finally,
      the DIBt scheme provides a useful starting point to develop further
      ecotoxicity guidelines for testing and data evaluation of leachates from
      construction materials.

ABSTRACT:
      Epoxy resins are among the most common causes of occupational contact
      dermatitis. They are normally used in so-called epoxy resin systems (ERS).
      These commercial products are combinations of epoxy resins, curing agents,
      modifiers, and reactive diluents. The most frequently used resins are
      diglycidyl ethers based on bisphenol A (DGEBA) and bisphenol F (DGEBF). In
      this study, we have investigated the contact allergenic properties of a
      series of analogues to the reactive diluent phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE),
      all with similar basic structures but with varying heteroatoms or with no
      heteroatom present. The chemical reactivity of the compounds in the test
      series toward the hexapeptide H-Pro-His-Cys-Lys-Arg-Met-OH was
      investigated. All epoxides were shown to bind covalently to both cysteine
      and proline residues. The percent depletion of nonreacted peptide was also
      studied resulting in ca. 60% depletion when using either PGE, phenyl
      2,3-epoxypropyl sulfide (2), or N-(2,3-epoxypropyl)aniline (3), and only
      15% when using 1,2-epoxy-4-phenylbutane (4) at the same time point. The
      skin sensitization potencies of the epoxides using the murine local lymph
      node assay (LLNA) were evaluated in relation to the observed
      physicochemical and reactivity properties. To enable determination of
      statistical significance between structurally closely related compounds, a
      nonpooled LLNA was performed. It was found that all investigated compounds
      containing a heteroatom in the &alpha;-position to the epoxide were strong
      sensitizers, congruent with the reactivity data, indicating that the
      impact of a heteroatom is crucial for the sensitizing capacity for this
      type of epoxides.

ABSTRACT:
      Few studies have addressed the cellular effects of bisphenol S (BPS) and
      bisphenol AF (BPAF) on cells, and no study has been conducted to analyze
      the mechanism of action of bisphenols in blood cells. In this study, the
      effect of bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), BPS and BPAF on human
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was analyzed. It was shown that
      BPA, BPF and BPAF in particular, decreased cell viability, which was
      associated with depletion of intracellular ATP level and alterations in
      PBMCs size and granulation. Bisphenols enhanced ROS (including OH&#729;)
      formation, which led to damage to lipids and proteins in PBMCs. The most
      significant alterations in ROS level were induced by BPF, and particularly
      BPAF. Moreover, it was shown that BPAF most strongly provoked lipid
      peroxidation, while BPA and BPS caused the greatest damage to proteins. It
      may be concluded that BPA and its analogs were capable of inducing
      oxidative stress and damage in PBMCs in the concentrations ranging from
      0.06 to 0.5 &mu;M (0.02-0.1 &mu;g/ml), which may be present in human blood
      as a result of environmental exposure. Although, most of bisphenols
      studied decreased cell viability, size and ATP level at higher
      concentrations, BPAF exhibited its cytotoxic potential at low
      concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 3 &mu;M (0.1-1.0 &mu;g/ml) that may
      correspond to concentrations in humans following occupational exposure.

ABSTRACT:
      A simple, rapid, sensitive and effective method for the simultaneous
      determination of four endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) (bisphenol A
      (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol AF (BPAF) and bisphenol AP (BPAP)) in
      environment water samples based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME)
      coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed.
      Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) adsorbents showed a good affinity to
      the target analytes. These compounds were rapidly extracted within 10 min.
      Various experimental parameters that could affect the extraction
      efficiencies had been investigated in detail. Under the optimum
      conditions, the enrichment factors of the method for the target EDCs were
      found to be 500. Satisfactory precision and accuracy of the method were
      obtained in a low concentration range of 2.0-500.0 ng mL(-1). The method
      detection limits were in the range of 0.10-0.30 ng mL(-1). The high
      pre-concentration rate and efficiency of the method ensure its successful
      application in extraction of trace EDCs from large volumes of
      environmental water samples. The extraction recoveries in real samples
      ranged from 85.3% to 102.5% with the relative standard deviations (n=5)
      less than 3.74%.

ABSTRACT:
      We performed a reporter gene assay for ERalpha-mediated transcriptional
      activation and an immature rat uterotrophic assay of 23 chemicals, to
      study the relationship between these two assays and to examine the
      usefulness of the reporter gene assay. The chemicals analyzed in the study
      were as follows: benzophenone, bisphenol A, bisphenol B, bisphenol F,
      p-cumyl phenol, dibutyl phthalate, dicyclohexylphthalate,
      dihydrotestosterone, equilin, 17alpha-estradiol, estrone, ethynyl
      estradiol, genistein, hematoxylin, nonylphenol mixture, 4-n-nonylphenol,
      norethindrone, norgestrel, octachlorostyrene, 4-n-octylphenol,
      4-tert-octylphenol, tributyltin-chloride and zearalenone. To perform the
      reporter gene assay, HeLa cells were transfected with a rat ERalpha
      expression construct and an estrogen-regulated luciferase reporter
      construct. The transcriptional activities of each chemical were tested
      over concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 10 microM and the EC50, PC50 and
      PC10 values were calculated. In the immature rat uterotrophic assay, the
      doses of 21 chemicals, with the exception of dibutyl phthalate and ethynyl
      estradiol, were 0, 2, 20 and 200 mg/kg; each group consisted of six rats.
      The doses of dibutyl phthalate and ethynyl estradiol were 0, 40, 200 and
      1000 mg/kg per day and 0, 0.2, 2 and 20 microg/kg per day, respectively.
      In the reporter gene assay, the PC10 values were calculated for 15
      chemicals: bisphenol A, bisphenol B, bisphenol F, p-cumyl phenol,
      dihydrotestosterone, equilin, 17alpha-estradiol, estrone, ethynyl
      estradiol, genistein, nonylphenol mixture, norethindrone, norgestrel,
      4-tert-octylphenol and zearalenone. These chemicals corresponded to the
      chemicals that tested positive in the uterotrophic assay. The other
      chemicals were negative in the reporter and uterotrophic assays. Although
      the EC50 and PC50 values could only be calculated for five and six
      chemicals, respectively, the PC10 values were shown to be well correlated
      with the EC50 values by a correlation analysis (R(2)=0.9202). These
      findings demonstrate that PC10 values are preferable to EC50 and PC50
      values for predicting the estrogenic activities of chemicals.

ABSTRACT:
      The estrogenic activities of 13 Bisphenol-A (BPA)-related chemicals for
      development of new polymers by three in vitro bioassay have been examined
      in the presence and absence of a post-mitochondrial metabolizing system
      (S9 mix). BPA, Bisphenol-B (BPB), Bisphenol-F (BPF), Bisphenol-S (BPS),
      4,4-ethylidenebisphenol (BP1), 4,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP2), 2,2-bis
      (4-hydroxyphenyl)-hexafluoropropane (BP3),
      4,4-(1,4-phenylenediisopropylidene) bisphenol (BP4),
      4,4-cyclohexylidenebisphenol (BP5), 4,4-dihydroxydiphenyl ether (BP6),
      4-hydroxydiphenylmethane (BP7), 4-cumylphenol (BP8) and
      4,4-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfide (BP9) were each diluted with dimethyl
      sulfoxide to final concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-3) M in both
      the yeast two-hybrid system and in a fluorescence polarization system.
      Dilutions of 10(-9) to 10(-4) M were assayed in the E-screen,
      respectively. Except for BPS and BP4, the chemicals tested showed
      estrogenic activity in the absence of cut S9 mix preparation and the
      activity was enhanced with S9 mix. BPS, which was initially negative, was
      active with S9 mix in the yeast two-hybrid system. BP2 was weakly
      estrogenic with or without S9 mix. Chemicals other than BP2 were positive
      in the competition binding assay. All chemicals tested showed estrogenic
      activity in the E-screen, the concentration level of which was 10(4) times
      lower than those of the other two assays.

ABSTRACT:
      In this study, concentrations of bisphenol A (BPA) and seven other
      bisphenols (BPs) were measured in urine samples collected from people
      living in and around e-waste dismantling facilities, and in matched
      reference population from rural and urban areas in China. BPA, bisphenol S
      (BPS), and bisphenol F (BPF) were frequently detected (detection
      frequencies:   >  90%) in urine samples collected from individuals who
      live near e-waste facilities, with geometric mean (GM) concentrations of
      2.99 (or 3.75), 0.361 (or 0.469), and 0.349 (or 0.435) ng/mL (or &mu;g/g
      Cre), respectively; the other five BPs were rarely found in urine samples,
      regardless of the sampling location. The urinary concentrations of BPA and
      BPF, but not BPS, were significantly higher in individuals from e-waste
      recycling locations than did individuals from a rural reference location.
      Our findings indicated that e-waste dismantling activities contribute to
      human exposure to BPA and BPF. 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was
      measured in urine as a marker of oxidative stress. In the e-waste
      dismantling location, urinary 8-OHdG was significantly and positively
      correlated (p   <  0.001) with urinary BPA and BPS, but not BPF; a similar
      correlation was also observed in reference sites. These findings suggest
      that BPA and BPS exposures are associated with elevated oxidative stress.

      (BADGE) and novolac glycidyl ether (NOGE) derivatives in extracts from
      food can coatings, tuna and oil. Fifteen samples of tuna cans bought in
      four European countries were investigated. Atmospheric pressure chemical
      ionization mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode (APCI(+)-MS) allowed
      to tentatively identify BADGE and NOGE related compounds originating from
      reactions of the glycidyl ethers with bisphenols, phenol, butanol, water
      and hydrochloric acid. Quantification was based on the external standard
      method and fluorescence detection. Mass fractions up to 3.7 micrograms/g
      were found for hydrochlorination products of bisphenol F diglycidyl ether
      (BFDGE + 2HCl) in tuna. Furthermore, total migration quantities of
      phenolic ether compounds were estimated. The highest values found were 20
      micrograms/g in tuna and 43 micrograms/g in the oil phase.

ABSTRACT:
      Twenty-eight chemicals used as dental materials and bisphenol-A related
      chemicals were diluted with DMSO to concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to
      10(-3) M and tested for estrogenicity. Bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-F
      (BPF) and bisphenol-A-bischloroformate (BPACF) showed estrogenic activity
      using the yeast two-hybrid system, and BPA, BPF, BPACF and bisphenol-S
      (BPS) showed estrogenic activity using the fluorescence polarization
      system. However, none of the remaining chemicals and none of the dental
      materials showed any activity at concentrations between 10(-7) and 10(-3)
      M. Although BPA, BPF, BPACF, bisphenol-A-dimethacrylate and BPS showed
      estrogenic activity in the E-screen test, the remaining chemicals did not.
      Thus, most of the chemicals showed consistent results, either positive or
      negative, by the three testing methods, while two chemicals showed
      conflicting results. Further studies, together with in vivo and
      epidemiological examinations, are required. Elucidation of the
      structure-activity relationships of these chemicals is also needed to
      estimate the estrogenicity of a chemical from its structure.

ABSTRACT:
      The biodegradation of waters polluted by some bisphenols, endowed with
      endocrine activity, has been studied by means of laccase or tyrosinase
      immobilized on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) beads. Bisphenol A (BPA), Bisphenol
      B (BPB), Bisphenol F (BPF) and Tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA) have been
      used. The laccase-PAN beads system has been characterized as a function of
      pH, temperature and substrate concentration. The biochemical parameters so
      obtained have been compared with those of the free enzyme to evidence the
      modification induced by the immobilization process. Once characterized,
      the laccase-PAN beads have been employed in a fluidized bed reactor to
      determine for each of the four bisphenols the degradation rate constant
      (k); the &tau;(50), i.e., the time to obtain the 50% of degradation, and
      the removal efficiency (RE(90)) after 90 min of enzyme treatment. The same
      parameters have been measured for each of the four pollutants with the
      same fluidized bed bioreactor loaded with tyrosinase-PAN beads. The
      internal comparison, i.e., in each of the two catalytic systems, has shown
      that both enzymes exhibit a removal efficiency in the following order
      BPF  > BPA  > BPB  > TCBPA. The external comparison, i.e., the comparison
      between the two catalytic system, has shown that the catalytic power of
      laccase were higher than that of tyrosinase. The operational stability of
      both catalytic systems resulted excellent, since they maintained more than
      80% of the initial activity after 30 days of work.

ABSTRACT:
      An improved analytical method enabling rapid and accurate determination
      and identification of bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (novolac glycidyl ether
      2-ring), novolac glycidyl ether 3-ring, novolac glycidyl ether 4-ring,
      novolac glycidyl ether 5-ring, novolac glycidyl ether 6-ring, bisphenol A
      diglycidyl ether, bisphenol A (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) glycidyl ether,
      bisphenol A (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) glycidyl ether, bisphenol A
      bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) ether, and bisphenol A
      (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether in canned food and
      their contact packaging materials has been developed by using, for the
      first time, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem
      mass spectrometry. After comparison of electrospray ionization and
      atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in positive and negative-ion
      modes, tandem mass spectrometry with positive electrospray ionization was
      chosen to carry out selective multiple reaction monitoring analysis of
      novolac glycidyl ethers, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, and its
      derivatives. The analysis time is only 5.5 min per run. Limits of
      detection varied from 0.01 to 0.20 ng g(-1) for the different target
      compounds on the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 3; limits of
      quantitation were from 0.03 to 0.66 ng g(-1). The relative standard
      deviation for repeatability was   < 8.01%. Analytical recovery ranged from
      87.60 to 108.93%. This method was successfully applied to twenty samples
      of canned food and their contact packaging materials for determination of
      migration of NOGE, BADGE, and their derivatives from can coatings into
      food.

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND: Few US studies have reported results of patch testing with
      plastics and glues.

      OBJECTIVE: To report our institution's results of testing patients
      suspected of allergy to plastics and glues with a comprehensive plastics
      and glues series and to compare these results with previously published
      data.

      METHODS: Retrospective review of results of patch-testing with plastics
      and glues allergens at our institution between 2000 and 2007. In total,
      444 patients were patch-tested with up to 56 plastics and glues allergens
      in the specialized series and up to five plastics and glues allergens in a
      baseline series. Positive-reaction rates were compared to other patch
      testing reports.

      RESULTS: Of patients, 97 (22%) had irritant reactions, and 201 (45%) had
      at least one allergic reaction. Bis(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether 1%,
      benzoyl peroxide 1%, epoxy resin, bisphenol F 0.25%, 2-hydroxyethyl
      methacrylate 2%, and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate 0.1% had the highest allergy
      reaction rates. Testing with specialized series identified 193 patients
      with plastics and glues allergy, of whom 162 were not identified by
      testing with baseline series alone.

      CONCLUSION: For patients suspected of allergy to plastics and glues,
      patch-testing with specialized series of plastics and glues allergens is
      an important adjunct to patch-testing with baseline series.

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND: Contact dermatitis has often been described in healthcare
      staff, resulting essentially from the use of natural rubber latex gloves,
      antiseptics, and especially aldehydes. This study reports an unusual cause
      of contact dermatitis in laboratory technicians.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients working in the bacteriology
      departments of three different hospitals were seen for airborne contact
      dermatitis. All were patch tested for specific plastics and glues.

      RESULTS: For all patients, positive patch reactions were obtained with
      classic epoxy resins, such as diglycidylether of bisphenol, as well as
      with new types, such as diglycidylether of bisphenol F and an
      epoxyacrylate resin.

      CONCLUSIONS: Although phenols and ether handled by the laboratory
      technicians and an epoxy mastic applied during floor repair were initially
      suspected, an immersion oil used in light microscopy proved to be the real
      cause of the dermatitis. To our knowledge, these are the first reported
      cases due to this type of contact.

ABSTRACT:
      Normal phase LC with gradient elution enabled the analysis of a broadened
      range of oligomers of BADGE (Bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether) and Novolak
      compounds in canned foods, such as sea foods in oil, meat products and
      soups. A major component released from Bisphenol-A resins was identified
      as the cyclo-(Bisphenol-A monoglycidyl ether) dimer and was commonly
      present in foods at concentrations of around 1 mg/kg. For the epoxy
      Novolaks, concentrations of the three- to six-ring compounds often far
      exceeded those of BFDGE (Bisphenol-F diglycidyl ether) and reached 20
      mg/kg in foods. A two-step acylation is proposed for the detection of
      epoxy components.

ABSTRACT:
      A novel Bisphenol A (4,4'-isopropylidenediphenol, BPA) sensor was
      developed harnessing an electrochemical platform comprising a
      layer-by-layer assembled reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrode and a
      designer probe specifically recognizing BPA. The BPA detection probe, a
      recombinant protein (LacI-BPA), was constructed by fusing a
      disulfide-constrained high affinity BPA binding peptide (CKSLENSYC) to the
      C-terminus of Lac repressor (LacI). Following expression and purification,
      the LacI-BPA was heat-denatured on-purpose to facilitate its direct
      adhesion on the rGO electrode surface via pi-stacking interaction. When
      the performance of the fabricated BPA sensor (LacI-BPA/rGO) was assessed
      by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it showed a wide linear
      dynamic range of BPA detection spanning from 100 fM to 10nM. Moreover, our
      BPA sensor exhibited negligible cross reactivity to BPA analogs such as
      Bisphenol S (BPS) and Bisphenol F (BPF) and almost complete spike recovery
      of BPA from plastic extracts containing various potential interferents.
      With these merits, the BPA sensor developed in the present study is
      expected to find practical application in selective and sensitive
      detection of BPA from diverse sample solutions.

ABSTRACT:
      The chemical structure of hydroxylated diphenylalkanes or bisphenols
      consists of two phenolic rings joined together through a bridging carbon.
      This class of endocrine disruptors that mimic estrogens is widely used in
      industry, particularly in plastics. Bisphenol F, bisphenol A,
      fluorine-containing bisphenol A (bisphenol AF), and other diphenylalkanes
      were found to be estrogenic in a bioassay with MCF7 human breast cancer
      cells in culture (E-SCREEN assay). Bisphenols promoted cell proliferation
      and increased the synthesis and secretion of cell type-specific proteins.
      When ranked by proliferative potency, the longer the alkyl substituent at
      the bridging carbon, the lower the concentration needed for maximal cell
      yield; the most active compound contained two propyl chains at the
      bridging carbon. Bisphenols with two hydroxyl groups in the para position
      and an angular configuration are suitable for appropriate hydrogen bonding
      to the acceptor site of the estrogen receptor. Our data suggest that
      estrogenicity is influenced not only by the length of the substituents at
      the bridging carbon but also by their nature. Because diphenylalkane
      derivatives are widespread and their production and use are increasing,
      potential exposure of humans to estrogenic bisphenols is becoming a
      significant issue. The hazardous effects of inadvertent exposure to
      bisphenol-releasing chemicals in professional workers and the general
      populations therefore deserve investigation.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenols, bisphenol A diglycidyl ethers (BADGEs), and novolac glycidyl
      ethers (NOGEs) are used in the production of epoxy resins and
      polycarbonate plastics. Despite the widespread application of these
      chemicals in household products, studies on their occurrence in indoor air
      are limited. In this study, 83 indoor air samples were collected in 2014
      from various locations in Albany, New York, USA, to determine the
      concentrations of bisphenols, BADGEs (refer to BADGE and its derivatives),
      and NOGEs (refer to NOGE and its derivatives) and to calculate inhalation
      exposure to these compounds. Among eight bisphenols measured, BPA, BPF,
      and BPS were found in bulk air (i.e., vapor plus particulate phases), at
      geometric mean (GM) concentrations of 0.43, 0.69 and
      0.09      ng      m(-3), respectively. Among 11 BADGEs and NOGEs
      determined, BADGE&middot;2H2O was the predominant compound found in indoor
      air (detection rate [DR]: 85.5%), at concentrations as high as
      6.71      ng      m(-3). Estimation of inhalation exposure to these
      chemicals for various age groups showed that teenagers had the highest
      exposure doses to BPA, BPF, BPS, and BADGE&middot;2H2O at 5.91, 9.48,
      1.24, and 3.84      ng day(-1), respectively. The body weight-normalized
      estimates of exposure were the highest for infants, with values at 0.24,
      0.39, 0.05, and 0.16      ng      kg bw(-1) day(-1) for BPA, BPF, BPS, and
      BADGE&middot;2H2O, respectively. This is the first survey to report
      inhalation exposure to bisphenols, BADGEs, and NOGEs.

ABSTRACT:
      The association between bisphenol A (BPA) exposure and adult health status
      is examined by measuring the urinary BPA concentration using a
      miniaturized technique based on dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction
      (DLLME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
      Both the free bioactive and the glucuronide conjugated forms of BPA were
      measured, the glucuronide form usually being predominant. The main analogs
      of BPA, including bisphenol Z (BPZ), bisphenol F (BPF) and biphenol (BP)
      were also determined. Several parameters affecting enzymatic hydrolysis,
      derivatization by in-situ acetylation and the DLLME stages were carefully
      optimized by means of multivariate designs. DLLME parameters were 2mL
      urine, 1mL acetone and 100&mu;L chloroform, and hydrolysis was performed
      using &beta;-glucuronidase and sulfatase at pH 5. No matrix effect was
      observed and quantification was carried out by aqueous calibration with a
      surrogate standard. Detection limits were in the range 0.01-0.04ngmL(-1).
      The intraday and interday precisions were lower than 11% in terms of
      relative standard deviation. Satisfactory values for all compounds were
      obtained in recovery studies (92-117%) at two concentration levels. Other
      bisphenols (BPF, BPZ and BP) were not detected in the urine samples, while
      BPA was the only bisphenol detected in the free form (creatinine adjusted)
      at concentration levels ranging from the detection limit to 15.9ngg(-1),
      and total BPA was detected at concentrations ranging from 0.46 to
      24.5ngg(-1) levels. A comparison of the BPA content for both groups of
      patients revealed that slightly higher mean values were obtained for both
      free BPA and total BPA for diabetic patients, than for non-diabetic
      patients. However, a statistical comparison of the contents of BPA
      revealed that there were no significant differences. The procedure was
      validated using a certified reference material.

ABSTRACT:
      The present work describes the development and validation of an analytical
      method based on liquid chromatography (LC), coupled with tandem mass
      spectrometry (MS/MS) that allows the determination and confirmation of
      several endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in honey. The EDCs studied
      were nine phenols of different nature: chlorophenols (2,4-dichlorophenol,
      2,4,5-trichlorophenol, and pentachlorophenol), alkylphenols
      (4-tert-butylphenol, 4-tert-octylphenol, and 4-n-octylphenol) bisphenols
      (bisphenol-A and bisphenol-F), and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid. The method
      incorporates a restricted-access material (RAM), coupled on-line to the
      LC-MS/MS system, which allows direct injection of the matrix into the
      RAM-LC-MS/MS system. The optimized method developed, RAM-LC-MS/MS, was
      applied to fortified honey samples, affording detection limits in the
      0.6-7.2 ng g(-1) range, calculated for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. In
      addition, the method was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method
      according to European Union Decision 2002/657/EC. The validation criteria
      evaluated were linearity, repeatability, reproducibility, recovery,
      decision limits, detection capabilities, specificity, and ruggedness.
      Repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility were evaluated at two
      concentration levels, being +/-11% or below at 20 ng g(-1). The decision
      limits (CC(alpha)) and detection capabilities (CC(beta)) were in the
      1.7-12.6 and 2.8-21.6 ng g(-1) range, respectively.

ABSTRACT:
      BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  From the local market, 270 products of
      canned food in aqueous matrix were analyzed for BADGE, BFDGE and their
      reaction products with water and hydrochloric acid. With the exception of
      two products containing some oil, none of them contained expoxy compounds.
      11 products had to be taken from the market because the sum of BADGE.2HCl
      plus BADGE.HCl.H2O exceeded the provisional Swiss legal limit of 1 mg/kg
      or because of substantial contents of non-authorized BFDGE derivatives.
      The most important products of concern were sweet corn in deep-drawn
      2-piece cans and asparagus in classical 3-piece cans. 103 products
      exceeded the temporary tolerance value of 200 mug/kg defined for the sum
      of all derivatives, in most cases because of BADGE.2H2O. More than 75% of
      the contaminant material was in the solids of the foods. Extraction of
      coatings by foods reached efficiencies of around 50% for sterilized p
      roducts, but remained below 10% for the non-sterilized. Chlorohydroxy
      compounds were extractedmore efficiently.

ABSTRACT:
      Epoxy resins incorporating bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and
      novolac glycidyl ether (NOGE) are used in a wide range of applications,
      including adhesives, structural and electrical laminates. However, little
      is known about the occurrence of BADGE, NOGE, and their derivatives in the
      environment. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, BADGE,
      bisphenol F glycidyl ether (BFDGE), 3-ring NOGE, and eight of their
      derivatives (BADGE&middot;2 H2O, BADGE&middot;H2O,
      BADGE&middot;HCl&middot;H2O, BADGE&middot;2 HCl, BADGE&middot;HCl,
      BFDGE&middot;2 H2O, and BFDGE&middot;2 HCl) were determined in archived
      biosolid samples collected from 68 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
      from the northeastern, midwestern, western, and southern regions of the
      USA. BADGE&middot;2 H2O was the most frequently detected (DR = 99%) and
      the most abundant compound found (median: 93.6 ng/g dry weight [dw]) in
      this family. The highest total concentrations of target chemicals, ranging
      from 83.6 to 2490 ng/g dw, were found in biosolids collected from the
      northeastern United States. The sum of geometric mean (GM) concentration
      of BADGE, NOGE, and their derivatives in biosolids increased with the
      treatment capacity of WWTPs. Based on the measured concentrations in
      biosolids and predicted mass in wastewater, it was estimated that
      approximately 3.5% of the total production of BADGEs was emitted through
      WWTP discharges.

ABSTRACT:
      An extraction-preconcentration procedure based on the use of a molecularly
      imprinted polymer (MIP) as selective sorbent has been developed for the
      determination of several phenolic compounds (bisphenol-A, bisphenol-F and
      4-nitrophenol) and phenoxyacid herbicides (2,4-D, 2,4,5-T and 2,4,5-TP) in
      honey samples. Liquid chromatography with diode array detection (LC-DAD)
      and electrospray ionisation-ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-IT-MS) were
      used for the separation, identification and quantification of these
      analytes. The molecularly imprinted polymer was obtained by precipitation
      polymerisation with bisphenol-A (BPA) as template and 4-vinylpyridine as
      the functional monomer. The behaviour of this sorbent was compared with
      those of other materials frequently used in SPE. The selectivity of the
      BPA-MIP for the target analytes was tested in samples containing other
      pesticides in common use. The recoveries achieved for all six compounds
      were in the 81-96% range. By applying the proposed procedure prior to
      LC-IT-MS, the limits of detection achieved in commercial honey samples
      were in the 0.1-3.8 ng g(-1) range, with relative standard deviations of
      12-24%.

ABSTRACT:
      BACKGROUND: Increasing concern over bisphenol A (BPA) as an
      endocrine-disrupting chemical and its possible effects on human health
      have prompted the removal of BPA from consumer products, often labeled
      "BPA-free." Some of the chemical replacements, however, are also
      bisphenols and may have similar physiological effects in organisms.
      Bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) are two such BPA substitutes.

      OBJECTIVES: This review was carried out to evaluate the physiological
      effects and endocrine activities of the BPA substitutes BPS and BPF.
      Further, we compared the hormonal potency of BPS and BPF to that of BPA.

      METHODS: We conducted a systematic review based on the Office of Health
      Assessment and Translation (OHAT) protocol.

      RESULTS: We identified the body of literature to date, consisting of 32
      studies (25 in vitro only, and 7 in vivo). The majority of these studies
      examined the hormonal activities of BPS and BPF and found their potency to
      be in the same order of magnitude and of similar action as BPA
      (estrogenic, antiestrogenic, androgenic, and antiandrogenic) in vitro and
      in vivo. BPS also has potencies similar to that of estradiol in
      membrane-mediated pathways, which are important for cellular actions such
      as proliferation, differentiation, and death. BPS and BPF also showed
      other effects in vitro and in vivo, such as altered organ weights,
      reproductive end points, and enzyme expression.

      CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current literature, BPS and BPF are as
      hormonally active as BPA, and they have endocrine-disrupting effects.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenols are important chemicals that are widely used in the
      manufacturing of polycarbonates, epoxy resin and thermal paper, and thus
      the exposure of humans to these substances has been noted. The purpose of
      this study was to assess eryptotic changes in human erythrocytes exposed
      (in vitro) to bisphenol A (BPA) and its selected analogs, i.e.,bisphenol F
      (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol AF (BPAF). The erythrocytes were
      incubated with compounds studied at concentrations ranging from 1 to
      250&mu;g/mL for 4, 12 or 24h. The results showed that BPA and its analogs
      increased cytosolic calcium ions level with the strongest effect noted for
      BPAF. It has also been revealed that all bisphenols analyzed, and BPAF and
      BPF in particular increased phosphatidylserine translocation in red blood
      cells, which confirmed that they exhibited eryptotic potential in this
      cell type. Furthermore, it was shown that BPA and its analogs caused
      significant increase in calpain and caspase-3 activities, while the
      strongest effect was noted for BPAF. BPS, which is the main substituent of
      bisphenol A in polymers and thermal paper production exhibited similar
      eryptotic potential to BPA. Eryptotic changes in human erythrocytes were
      provoked by bisphenols at concentrations, which may influence the human
      body during occupational exposure or subacute poisoning with these
      compounds.

ABSTRACT:
      Although much information on the endocrine activity of bisphenol A (BPA)
      is available, a proper human hazard assessment of analogues that are
      believed to have a less harmful toxicity profile is lacking. Here the
      possible effects of BPA, bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS), as well as
      the brominated structural analogue and widely used flame retardant
      tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) on human glucocorticoid and androgen
      receptor (GR and AR) activation were assessed. BPA, BPF, and TBBPA showed
      clear GR and AR antagonism with IC50 values of 67 &mu;M, 60 &mu;M, and 22
      nM for GR, and 39 &mu;M, 20 &mu;M, and 982 nM for AR, respectively,
      whereas BPS did not affect receptor activity. In addition, murine MA-10
      Leydig cells exposed to the bisphenol analogues were assessed for changes
      in secreted steroid hormone levels. Testicular steroidogenesis was altered
      by all bisphenol analogues tested. TBBPA effects were more directed
      towards the male end products and induced testosterone synthesis, while
      BPF and BPS predominantly increased the levels of progestagens that are
      formed in the beginning of the steroidogenic pathway. The MA-10 Leydig
      cell assay shows added value over the widely used H295R steroidogenesis
      assay because of its fetal-like characteristics and specificity for the
      physiologically more relevant testicular &Delta;4 steroidogenic pathway.
      Therefore, adding an in vitro assay covering fetal testicular
      steroidogenesis, such as the MA-10 cell line, to the panel of tests used
      to screen potential endocrine disruptors, is highly recommendable.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE)- and bisphenol F diglycidyl ether
      (BFDGE)-based epoxy resins have a broad range of applications, including
      serving as inner coatings of food and beverage cans and as protective
      coatings in marine construction. Prior to this study, no studies had
      examined the occurrence and bioaccumulation of BADGEs or BFDGEs in aquatic
      organisms. In this study, BADGE, BFDGE, and nine of their derivatives were
      determined in 121 tissue (liver, kidney, blubber, and brain) samples from
      eight species of marine mammals collected from the U.S. coastal waters of
      Florida, California, Washington, and Alaska. BADGE&middot;2HCl was the
      predominant compound found in the majority (78.5%) of the marine mammal
      tissues analyzed, at concentrations of up to 2950 ng/g (wet weight (wt))
      found in the liver of a sea otter from Kachemak Bay, Alaska. The measured
      concentrations of BADGE&middot;2HCl in marine mammals were on the order of
      hundreds of nanograms per gram tissue, which are some of the highest
      concentrations ever reported for this compound in biota. Males contained
      greater concentrations of BADGE&middot;2HCl than did females.
      BADGE&middot;2HCl also was found in the brain tissues of sea otters. Trace
      levels of BADGE&middot;2HCl were found in the livers of polar bears from
      Alaska, which suggested that BADGEs are widely distributed in the oceanic
      environment.

ABSTRACT:
      In the present study, we have investigated DNA-damaging potential of BPA
      and its analogs, i.e. bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol
      AF (BPAF) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using the
      alkaline and neutral versions of the comet assay, which allowed to
      evaluate DNA single strand-breaks (SSBs) and double strand-breaks (DSBs).
      The use of the alkaline version of comet assay made also possible to
      analyze the kinetics of DNA repair in PBMCs after exposure of the cells to
      BPA or its analogs. We have observed an increase in DNA damage in PBMCs
      treated with BPA or its analogs in the concentrations ranging from 0.01 to
      10      &mu;g/ml after 1 and 4 h incubation. It was noted that bisphenols
      studied caused DNA damage mainly via SSBs, while DNA fragmentation via
      double DSBs was low. The strongest changes in DNA damage were provoked by
      BPA and particularly BPAF, which were capable of inducing SSBs even at
      0.01      &mu;g/ml, while BPS caused the lowest changes (only at
      10      &mu;g/ml). We have also observed that PBMCs significantly repaired
      bisphenols-induced DNA damage but they were unable (excluding cells
      treated with BPS) to repair totally DNA breaks.

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely used chemical that has been extensively
      studied as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC). Other bisphenols
      sharing close structural features with BPA, are increasingly being used as
      alternatives, increasing the need to assess associated hazards to the
      endocrine system. In the present study, the estrogenic activity of BPA,
      bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) was assessed by using a
      combination of zebrafish-specific mechanism-based in vitro and in vivo
      assays. The three bisphenols were found to efficiently transactivate all
      zebrafish estrogen receptor (zfER) subtypes in zebrafish hepatic reporter
      cell lines (ZELH-zfERs). BPA was selective for zfER&alpha; while BPS and
      BPF were slightly more potent on zfER&beta; subtypes. We further
      documented the estrogenic effect in vivo by quantifying the expression of
      brain aromatase using a transgenic cyp19a1b-GFP zebrafish embryo assay.
      All three bisphenols induced GFP in a concentration-dependent manner. BPS
      only partially induced brain aromatase at the highest tested
      concentrations (  > 30&micro;M) while BPA and BPF strongly induced GFP, in
      an ER-dependent manner, at 1-10&micro;M. Furthermore, we show that BPF
      strongly induced vitellogenin synthesis in adult male zebrafish. Overall,
      this study demonstrates the estrogenic activity of BPA, BPF and BPS in
      different cell- and tissue-contexts and at different stages of
      development. Differences between in vitro and in vivo responses are
      discussed in light of selective ER activation and the fate of the
      compounds in the models. This study confirms the relevance of combining
      cellular and whole-organism bioassays in a unique model species for the
      hazard assessment of candidate EDCs.

ABSTRACT:
      This article reviews recent literature on current methodologies based on
      chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to analyze phenolic compounds
      with endocrine-disrupting capabilities. For this review we chose
      alkylphenol ethoxylates, bisphenol A, bisphenol F, and their degradation
      products and halogenated derivatives, which are considered important
      environmental contaminants. Additionally, some related compounds such as
      bisphenol diglycidylethers were included. Growing attention has been paid
      to the mass spectrometric characterization of these compounds and the
      instrumentation and strategies used for their quantification and
      confirmation. The current use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
      (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methodologies
      with different mass spectrometers and ionization and monitoring modes is
      discussed. Practical aspects with regards to the use of these analytical
      techniques, such as derivatizing reagents in GC-MS, ion suppression in
      LC-MS, and the most problematic aspects of quantification, are included in
      the discussion.

ABSTRACT:
      Alternatives to bisphenol A (BPA) are more and more used in thermal paper
      receipts. To get an overview of the situation in Switzerland, 124 thermal
      paper receipts were collected and analyzed. Whereas BPA was detected in
      most samples (n=100), some alternatives, namely bisphenol S (BPS),
      Pergafast&reg; 201 and D-8 have been found in 4, 11 and 9 samples
      respectively. As no or few data on their endocrine activity are available,
      these chemicals and bisphenol F (BPF) were tested in vitro using the H295R
      steroidogenesis assay. 17&beta;-Estradiol production was induced by BPA
      and BPF, whereas free testosterone production was inhibited by BPA and
      BPS. Both non-bisphenol substances did not show significant effects. The
      binding affinity to 16 proteins and the toxicological potential (TP) were
      further calculated in silico using VirtualToxLab&trade;. TP values lay
      between 0.269 and 0.476 and the main target was the estrogen receptor
      &beta; (84.4 nM to 1.33 &mu;M). A substitution of BPA by BPF and BPS
      should be thus considered with caution, since they exhibit almost a
      similar endocrine activity as BPA. D-8 and Pergafast&reg; 201 could be
      alternatives to replace BPA, however further analyses are needed to better
      characterize their effects on the hormonal system.

ABSTRACT:
      There is a potential risk to the environment from persistent estrogenic
      compounds in sewage sludge. In this study, eight bisphenols (BPs) were
      identified in sewage sludge collected from wastewater treatment plants in
      15 cities in China. The estrogenic potencies of the eight BPs and the
      estrogenic activities of sludge samples were evaluated using a
      bioluminescence yeast estrogen screen (BLYES) assay. All sludge samples
      elicited considerable estrogenic activity at a range of 2.8-4.7 ng E2
      g(-1) dry weight (dw). All BPs exhibited estrogenic activity in the BLYES
      assay, but there were significant differences between the potency of
      individual chemicals. Bisphenol AF had the highest activity, followed by
      tetrachlorobisphenol A, bisphenol F, bisphenol A, bisphenol E, bisphenol S
      and 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone. Tetrabromobisphenol A showed weak
      estrogenic activity at 1&times;10(4)nM, but significant cytotoxicity above
      this concentration. The total estradiol equivalency quantities (EEQs) of
      BPs were in the range of 2.16-49.13 pg E2 g(-1) dw, accounting for
      0.05-1.47% of the total EEQs in sewage sludge samples. The results
      indicate that BPs made a minor contribution to the estrogenic activity of
      the investigated sewage sludge. Nevertheless, our results suggest that
      considerable attention should be directed to the estrogenic potentials of
      emerging organic pollutants because of their widespread use and their
      potential to persist in the environment.

ABSTRACT:
 Sphingobiumobium xenophagum Bayram is capable of metabolizing 4-alkoxyphenols
      and endocrine disruptive alpha-quaternary 4-nonylphenols by an
      ipso-substitution mechanism that involves ring hydroxylation at the site
      of the substituent. Here, we show that Bayram's ipso-hydroxylating
      activity was able to transform also bisphenol A (=
      dimethyl-4,4'-methylenediphenol; BPA) and 4-isopropylphenol. We identified
      six metabolites when resting cells of strain Bayram were incubated with
      BPA. They were unambiguously characterized by HPLC-UV, HPLC/MS, and
      HPLC/MS/MS as hydroquinone, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)isopropanol,
      4-isopropenylphenol, 4-isopropylphenol,
      4-hydroxy-4-isopropenylcyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one, and
      4-hydroxy-4-isopropylcyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one. In experiments with
      4-isopropylphenol as a substrate,
      4-hydroxy-4-isopropylcyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one, one of the metabolites from
      BPA, accumulated to a high degree. We could rationalize the formation of
      all metabolites by invoking ipso-hydroxylation and ipso-substitution
      mechanisms. On closer view, also classical bacterial metabolism of BPA can
      be well rationalized by an ipso-substitution mechanism, albeit with
      ipso-attack of an internal alkyl radical instead of an activated oxygen
      species. This highlights the important role of ipso-substitution as a
      versatile degradative principle utilized by diverse organisms to degrade
      alpha-quaternary 4-nonylphenols, 4-alkoxyphenols, and BPA.

ABSTRACT:
      BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Normal phase LC with gradient elution
      enabled the analysis of a broadened range of oligomers of BADGE
      (Bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether) and Novolak compounds in canned foods, such
      as sea foods in oil, meat products and soups. A major component released
      from Bisphenol-A resins was identified as the cyclo-(Bisphenol-A
      monoglycidyl ether) dimer and was commonly present in foods at
      concentrations of around 1 mg/kg. For the epoxy Novolaks, concentrations
      of the three- to six-ring compounds often far  exceeded those of BFDGE
      (Bisphenol-F diglycidyl ether) and reached 20 mg/kg in foods. A two-step
      acylation is proposed for the detection of epoxy components.

ABSTRACT:
      [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this
      project is to develop an improved dental composite with low polymerization
      stress using nanoclay fillers producing improved mechanical properties
      combined with BisGMA/TEGDEMA and/or oxirane resins. This project is an
      interdisciplinary effort involving three separate institutions, UMKC, UMR,
      and Mo-Sci Company. Hypothesis 1 (nanoclay fillers) The addition of
      nanoclay fillers will improve the mechanical properties of the
      BisGMA/TEGDMA (50:50) and UVR6105/GY281/PTHF (48:48:4) resin systems.
      Specific Aim: To determine an optimum surface modification and
      concentration of nanoclay fillers in each polymer matrix system, (see
      hypothesis 2 below), in order to select a binder-nanoparticle system that
      will provide optimal mechanical properties in a hybrid filled composite
      (see hypothesis 3 below). Hypothesis 2 (stress-reducing polymer) The
      incorporation of a spiroorthocarbonate (TOSU) into two different matrix
      resins, Bisphenol-A-glycidyldimethacrylate (BisGMA)/ triethylene glycol
      dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) (50:50) and
      3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclo-hexylcarboxylate
      (UVR6105)/Diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol F (GY281)/Poly(tetrahydrofuran)
      (PTHF) (48:48:4), will reduce the polymerization stress of the neat
      resins.  Specific Aim 1 To determine the most appropriate
      spiroorthocarbonate and the optimal addition level that will significantly
      reduce the polymerization stress of BisGMA/TEGDMA. The TOSUs will be added
      to the resin at weight percents of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20%. Specific Aim 2 To
      add two appropriate TOSUs to the UVR6105/GY281/PTHF (48:48:4) resin. The
      TOSUs will be added in concentrations as specified in Specific Aim 1.
      Hypothesis 3 (glass fillers) The addition of radio-opaque REAS glass
      fillers to the matrix resins, will produce a nano-hybrid composite with
      superior mechanical properties to current dental composites. Specific Aim
      1 Select an appropriate alkali-free rare-earth aluminosilicate (REAS)
      glass that matches the refractive index of the cured resins. This glass
      will be processed into glass powder of appropriate particle size
      distribution (PSD) having average diameter between 0.05 and 5 microns.
      Specific Aim 2 Surface-treat the glass fillers with an appropriate
      coupling agent (either silane, or titanate or zirconate) will be
      incorporated into the matrix resin. Criteria for incorporation will
      include the surface treatment, PSD of the glass particles, and loading
      level of the glass particles into the composite. Specific aim 3 Compare
      properties (mechanical, optical, chemical) of alkali-free rare-earth REAS
      glass-modified composites to commercial dental composites. Successful
      completion of the proposed research will result in significant
      contributions to dental public health, including: (a) a restorative with
      significantly reduced polymerization stress which should increase the
      durability and longevity of the restoration; (b) a restorative with
      enhanced depth of cure that can be bulk placed which will save clinical
      time and resources; and (c) a significantly improved understanding of
      methacrylate and oxirane-based polymeric materials containing
      nano-fillers.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable]

ABSTRACT:
      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is
      to develop an improved dental composite with low polymerization stress
      using nanoclay fillers producing improved mechanical properties combined
      with BisGMA/TEGDEMA and/or oxirane resins. This project is an
      interdisciplinary effort involving three separate institutions, UMKC, UMR,
      and Mo-Sci Company. Hypothesis 1 (nanoclay fillers) The addition of
      nanoclay fillers will improve the mechanical properties of the
      BisGMA/TEGDMA (50:50) and UVR6105/GY281/PTHF (48:48:4) resin systems.
      Specific Aim: To determine an optimum surface modification and
      concentration of nanoclay fillers in each polymer matrix system, (see
      hypothesis 2 below), in order to select a binder-nanoparticle system that
      will provide optimal mechanical properties in a hybrid filled composite
      (see hypothesis 3 below). Hypothesis 2 (stress-reducing polymer) The
      incorporation of a spiroorthocarbonate (TOSU) into two different matrix
      resins, Bisphenol-A-glycidyldimethacrylate (BisGMA)/ triethylene glycol
      dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) (50:50) and
      3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclo-hexylcarboxylate
      (UVR6105)/Diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol F (GY281)/Poly(tetrahydrofuran)
      (PTHF) (48:48:4), will reduce the polymerization stress of the neat
      resins.  Specific Aim 1 To determine the most appropriate
      spiroorthocarbonate and the optimal addition level that will significantly
      reduce the polymerization stress of BisGMA/TEGDMA. The TOSUs will be added
      to the resin at weight percents of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20%. Specific Aim 2 To
      add two appropriate TOSUs to the UVR6105/GY281/PTHF (48:48:4) resin. The
      TOSUs will be added in concentrations as specified in Specific Aim 1.
      Hypothesis 3 (glass fillers) The addition of radio-opaque REAS glass
      fillers to the matrix resins, will produce a nano-hybrid composite with
      superior mechanical properties to current dental composites. Specific Aim
      1 Select an appropriate alkali-free rare-earth aluminosilicate (REAS)
      glass that matches the refractive index of the cured resins. This glass
      will be processed into glass powder of appropriate particle size
      distribution (PSD) having average diameter between 0.05 and 5 microns.
      Specific Aim 2 Surface-treat the glass fillers with an appropriate
      coupling agent (either silane, or titanate or zirconate) will be
      incorporated into the matrix resin. Criteria for incorporation will
      include the surface treatment, PSD of the glass particles, and loading
      level of the glass particles into the composite. Specific aim 3 Compare
      properties (mechanical, optical, chemical) of alkali-free rare-earth REAS
      glass-modified composites to commercial dental composites. Successful
      completion of the proposed research will result in significant

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenol-A (BPA) is one of the most abundant synthetic chemicals in the
      world due to its uses in plastics. Its widespread exposure vis-a-vis low
      dose effects led to a reduction in its safety dose and imposition of ban
      on its use in infant feeding bottles. This restriction paved the way for
      the gradual market entry of its analogues. However, their structural
      similarity to BPA has put them under surveillance for endocrine disrupting
      potential. The application of these analogues is increasing and so are the
      studies reporting their toxicity. This review highlights the reasons which
      led to the ban of BPA and also reports the exposure and toxicological data
      available on its analogues. Hence, this compilation is expected to answer
      in a better way whether the replacement of BPA by these analogues is safer
      or more harmful?

ABSTRACT:
      Bisphenols, in particular bisphenol-A (BP-A), are monomers of various
      plastics including polycarbonates and epoxy resins which are used in
      numerous consumer products. The release of BP-A from some of these
      materials has recently been reported. BP-A is a weak estrogen and
      structurally related to the aneuploidogenic stilbene estrogen
      diethylstilbestrol (DES). We have therefore studied BP-A and four other
      bisphenols for their aneuploidogenic potential by assaying their (i)
      interference with the cell-free assembly of microtubules (MT); (ii)
      disruption of the cytoplasmic MT complex in cultured Chinese hamster V79
      cells; (iii) disruption of the mitotic spindle and induction of metaphase
      arrest in V79 cells; and (iv) induction of micronuclei (MN) in V79 cells.
      At concentrations without gross cytotoxicity, BP-A as well as its
      alkyl-fluorinated and ring-methylated analog were active at all endpoints
      tested, whereas the bisphenol without alkyl groups was completely
      inactive. 4,4'-Dihydroxybenzophenone was inactive against cell-free and
      cytoplasmic MT but disrupted the mitotic spindle and induced metaphase
      arrest and MN. The MN caused by the various bisphenols were analyzed for
      the presence of kinetochores by staining with CREST antibodies. All
      induced MN were CREST-positive, implying that they contain whole
      chromosomes/chromatids. The effects on MT and the induction of metaphase
      arrest and of CREST-positive MN suggest that the environmental estrogen
      BP-A and some of its analogs are potential aneuploidogens.

ABSTRACT:
      Coacervates made up of vesicles of decanoic acid, induced by
      tetrabutylammonium, are proposed for the extraction of bisphenols A and F
      (BPA, BPF) and their corresponding diglycidyl ethers (BADGE and BFDGE)
      from sewage and river water. The driving forces for the extraction were
      hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and pi-cation. Actual concentration factors
      depended mainly on the amount of decanoic acid and tetrabutylammonium
      making up the coacervate. Under optimal experimental conditions, they were
      569, 561, 500 and 477 for BPA, BPF, BADGE and BFGDE, respectively.
      Extractions were independent of the presence of salts up to 1M and the
      temperature up to 60 degrees C. Equilibrium conditions were reached in 5
      min. The combination of vesicular coacervation with liquid chromatography
      and fluorescence detection at lambda(exc) 278 nm and lambda(em) 306 nm
      permitted the quantification of the target pollutants with detection
      limits of 9-10 ng/L. The method was applied to their determination in raw
      and treated sewage and river samples. No clean-up steps were necessary.
      Apparent recoveries of bisphenols and their diglycidyl ethers in the
      environmental water samples ranged from 95 to 102%. The concentrations of
      BPA and BPF in samples were between 0.1 and 1.7 microg/L. BADGE was found
      mainly in wastewater influents, at concentrations ranging between 0.49 and
      1.15 microg/L, whereas BFDGE was only found in one of the 11 samples
      analysed.

      endocrine activity were selected for evaluation of potential
      (anti)glucocorticoid and (anti)androgenic activities. The human breast
      carcinoma MDA-kb2 cell line was utilized for reporter gene assays, since
      it expresses both the androgen and the glucocorticoid-responsive reporter.
      Two new antiandrogens, 4,4'-sulfonylbis(2-methylphenol) (dBPS) and
      4,4'-thiodiphenol (THIO), and two new antiglucocorticoids, bisphenol Z and
      its analog bis[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl] sulfone (BHEPS) were identified.
      Moreover, four new glucocorticoid agonists (methyl paraben, ethyl paraben,
      propyl paraben and bisphenol F) were found. To elucidate the
      structure-activity relationship of bisphenols, we performed molecular
      docking experiments with androgen and glucocorticoid receptor. These
      docking experiments had shown that bulky structures such as BHEPS and
      bisphenol Z act as antiglucocorticoid, because they are positioned toward
      helix H12 in the antagonist conformation and could therefore be
      responsible for H12 conformational change and the switch between agonistic
      and antagonistic conformation of receptor. On the other hand smaller
      structures cannot interact with H12. The results of in vitro screening of
      fifteen industrial chemicals as modulators of the glucocorticoid and
      androgen receptor activities demand additional in vivo testing of these
      chemicals for formulating any relevant hazard identification to human
      health.

ABSTRACT:
      Arthrobacter sp. strain YC-RL1, capable of utilizing bisphenol A (BPA) as
      sole carbon source for growth, was isolated from petroleum contaminated
      soil. YC-RL1 could rapidly degrade BPA in a wide range of pH (5.0-9.0) and
      temperature (20-40 &deg;C). Substrate analysis found that YC-RL1 could
      also degrade bisphenol F (BPF) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). The
      maximum and minimum concentrations of BPA (0.2-600 mg/L), BPF (0.2-600
      mg/L), and TBBPA (0.2-300 mg/L) for efficient biodegradation were
      detected. The released bromide ion and metabolic intermediates of BPF and
      BPA/TBBPA were detected, as well as the degradation pathways for BPF and
      BPA/TBBPA were deduced tentatively. The present study provides important
      information for the investigation of BPs degrading mechanism and the
      application of microbial remediation in BP-contaminated environment. This
      study is the first report about a genus Arthrobacter bacterium which could
      simultaneously degrade BPA, BPF, and TBBPA.

ABSTRACT:
      Phthalate esters, alkylphenols, bisphenol A and their chlorinated
      derivatives are the suspected endocrine disrupters or mutagens. These
      compounds, commonly called endocrine disrupter chemicals (EDCs), are
      widely used as plastic additives, lacquers, resins, or surfactants and can
      be usually found in environmental samples, namely wastewaters. An accurate
      and reproducible gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method is
      proposed to measure these compounds in wastewater samples of Granada city
      (Spain). A solid-phase extraction with LiChrolut RP-18 cartridges was
      carried out and the elution was performed with a diethyl ether/methanol
      mixture. After isolation, solvent was removed and a silylation step was
      carried out using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA).
      Phthalate esters and silylated compounds were identified and quantified by
      GC-MS using a ZB-5 MS column. Bisphenol F was used as a surrogate.
      Quantification limits found were between 20 ng L(-1) for 4-nonylphenol and
      400 ng L(-1) for benzylbutyl phthalate while inter and intra-day
      variability was under 5% in all cases. Recoveries for spiked samples were
      over 95% and under 105%. The method was validated using standard addition
      calibration and recovery assays.

ABSTRACT:
      A method involving extraction and LC-ESI-MS-MS detection of BADGE, BFDGE,
      BADGE*H2O, BADGE*2H2O, BADGE*HCl, BADGE*H2O*HCl, BADGE.2HCl and BFDGE*2HCl
      in aqueous cream was developed and validated. Initially, empty internally
      lacquered aluminum container closure systems were extracted with
      isopropanol as an attempt to estimate the upper limit of extractable
      bisphenol diglycidyl ethers present in lacquer. Six of the eight potential
      bisphenol diglycidyl ethers were quantified. In an accelerated experiment,
      on aqueous cream stored in lacquered aluminum tubes at 70 degrees C, all
      derivatives except BADGE*2HCl and BFDGE*2HCl were extracted from cream
      samples and quantified as an attempt to estimate the upper limit of
      compounds leaching to the cream. Detection limits were from 0.3+/-0.2 to
      3.4+/-0.7 microgl(-1). Recoveries were determined for all compounds at
      three concentration levels (mean 63+/-6%). Mean inter-day and mean
      intra-day precision was 7+/-2 and 13+/-6%, respectively. Three
      commercially available creams were obtained from a local community
      pharmacy and analysed for bisphenol diglycidyl ethers. BADGE, BADGE*H2O,
      BADGE*2H2O and BADGE*H2O*HCl were detected and quantified. In conclusion,
      the developed method allows for the extraction and detection of bisphenol
      diglycidyl ethers originating from the epoxy phenol lacquer used in
      aluminum tubes. This study does not indicate that they leach into aqueous
      cream in significant amounts under normal storage conditions.

ABSTRACT:
      The molecular recognition of various kinds of bisphenols (BPs) by a
      self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of thiolated calix[6]arene on a gold
      electrode was examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Based on the
      inhibitory effect of BPs on the inclusion of hydroquinone (HQ) as a probe
      bythe surface-confined calix[6]arene, the association constants (Kassoc)
      of BPs with the immobilized calix[6]arene were estimated. The Kassoc
      values for BPs with the SAM of thiolated hexasodium
      calix[6]arenehexasulfonic acid (thioSCX6) were much smaller than those in
      the free calix[6]arene derivative systems reported previously. The order
      of the Kassoc values for BPs with thioSCX6 was bisphenol A (BPA)   > 
      bisphenol S (BPS)   >  bisphenol B (BPB)   >  bisphenol F (BPF). The
      Kassoc values for BPA and BPS with thioSCX6 were larger than that for BPB,
      despite the larger hydrophobicity of BPB than that of BPA and BPS. This is
      probably because the inclusion phenomena in this system are not simply
      driven by the hydrophobic interaction, but are significantly affected by
      several steric and structural factors with immobilization of the host.
      Those are (1) a decrease in flexibility of the SCX6 cavity by the
      formation of SAM, (2) a decrease in inclusion ability of the SCX6 by the
      presence of Au surface just beneath it, and (3) a repulsion of hydrophobic
      guests bythe presence of sulfonate groups at the top of the SAM. Moreover,
      the association phenomena (adsorption and desorption processes) of a
      bisphenol with the SCX6 SAM were examined directly by using localized
      surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy.

ABSTRACT:
      The use of bisphenol A (BPA) has been restricted in many countries because
      of its potential health effects. As a result of these restrictions, a
      group of bisphenol analogues that are structurally similar to BPA have
      been developed as the alternatives for industrial applications. However,
      latest researches indicated that these chemicals have similar
      endocrine-disrupting effects as BPA in humans. Moreover, only a limited
      number of studies have attempted to monitor the exposure level in humans
      of other bisphenol analogues. In the present study, the concentrations of
      seven bisphenols, including bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF),
      bisphenol B (BPB), BPA, bisphenol AF (BPAF), tetrachlorobisphenol A
      (TCBPA) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), in human urine samples were
      measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
      following the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucuronidase/arylsulfatase and
      liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). Under the optimised conditions, high
      recoveries (81.6-116.8%) were obtained for all the analytes, and the
      relative standard deviations (RSD, %) were less than 16.4% (n=6). The
      isotopic internal standard calibration curves for each of the target
      compounds exhibited excellent linearity (r(2)  > 0.99) and the limit of
      quantification (LOQ) for the analytes in urine ranged from 0.024 to 0.310
      ng mL(-1). The method was applied to investigate the urinary levels of
      these seven bisphenols in a cohort of residents living near a BPAF
      manufacturing plant in south China. BPS, BPF, BPA and BPAF were detected
      in urine samples at concentrations ranging from   < LOQ to a few ng
      mL(-1), whereas BPB, TCBPA and TBBPA were not detected. This is the first
      study to report the occurrence of BPF and BPAF in human urine samples. The
      availability of rapid and simple analytical methods may be highly useful
      for the future biomonitoring of these compounds.
